    This document describes the high-level design of a Python-based application for Lexical Multi-Dimensional Analysis (LMDA), an extension of the Multi-Dimensional (MD) Analysis framework developed by Biber in the 1980s (``Multi-Feature Multi-Dimensional Analysis'') to study register variation. Through the identification of (lexical) dimensions or sets of correlated lexical features, LMDA enables the analysis of lexical patterning from a multi-dimensional perspective. These lexical dimensions represent a variety of latent, macro-level discursive constructs. \citep{berbersardinhaLexicalMultiDimensionalAnalysis2025}
