  abstract = {Researchers using corpora can visualise their data and analyses using a growing number of tools. Visualisations are especially valuable in environments where researchers communicate and work with public-facing partners under the auspices of `knowledge exchange' or `impact', and corpus data are more available thanks to digital methods. However, although the field of corpus linguistics continues to generate its own range of techniques, it largely remains orientated towards finding ways for academics to communicate results directly with other academics rather than with or through groups outside universities. Also, there is a lack of discussion about how communication, motivations and values also feature in the process of making corpus data visible. My argument is that these sociocultural and practical factors also influence visualisation outputs alongside technical aspects. I draw upon two corpus-based projects about press portrayal of migrants, conducted by an intermediary organisation that links university researchers with users outside academia. Analysing these projects' visualisation outputs in their organisational and communication contexts produces key lessons for researchers wanting to visualise text; consider the aims and values of partners; develop communication strategies that acknowledge different areas of expertise; and link visualisation choices with wider project objectives.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates educational landscapes, its impact on academic writing has become a subject of intense scrutiny. This research delved into the nuanced dimensions of authorship and voice in academic writing, specifically focusing on the application of OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this study, the research team compared and contrasted an essay written by one second-year English student for a course on English literature with a similar essay produced by ChatGPT. The current research also, tried to clarify whether artificial intelligence can satisfy the formal requirements of academic writing and maintain the distinctive voice inherent in human-authored content. The examination hinges on parameters such as assertiveness, self-identification, and authorial presence. Additionally, the researchers shed light on the challenges inherent in producing AI-generated academic text. While ChatGPT presented an ability to generate contextually relevant content, the results highlighted its need for support in guaranteeing factual accuracy and capturing the complex aspects of authorship that are common in human writing. Notably, when compared to human-generated text, the AI-generated text was deficient in terms of specificity, depth, and accurate source referencing. While AI has potential as an additional tool for academic writing, this study's findings indicated that its current capabilities---particularly in producing academic text are limited, and remain constrained. This study emphasizes upon the imperative for continued refinement and augmentation of AI models to bridge the existing gaps in achieving a more seamless integration into the academic writing landscape.}

Anne Bront{\"e} was the daughter of Patrick Bront{\"e}, a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England. Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire moors. Otherwise she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846 she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, Agnes Grey, was published in 1847 with Wuthering Heights. Her second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in 1848. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is thought to be one of the first feminist novels.Anne died at 29, probably of pulmonary tuberculosis. After Anne's death her sister Charlotte edited Agnes Grey to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. This is one reason why Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless both of Anne's novels are considered classics of English literature.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Pursuit of honest and truthful decision-making is crucial for governance and accountability in democracies. However, people sometimes take different perspectives of what it means to be honest and how to pursue truthfulness. Here we explore a continuum of perspectives from evidence-based reasoning, rooted in ascertainable facts and data, at one end, to intuitive decisions that are driven by feelings and subjective interpretations, at the other. We analyse the linguistic traces of those contrasting perspectives in congressional speeches from 1879 to 2022. We find that evidence-based language has continued to decline since the mid-1970s, together with a decline in legislative productivity. The decline was accompanied by increasing partisan polarization in Congress and rising income inequality in society. The results highlight the importance of evidence-based language in political decision-making.},

Authors examine a range of spoken, written, multimodal and electronic corpora covering themes which include health, academic writing, social class, ethnicity, gender, television narrative, news, Early Modern English and political speech.

This book critically explores how corpus linguistics techniques can help analysis of language and gender by conducting a number of case studies on topics which include: directives in spoken conversations, changes in sexist and non-sexist language use over time, personal adverts, press representation of gay men, and the ways that boys and girls are constructed through language. The book thus covers both gendered usage (e.g. how do males and females use language differently, or not, from each other), and gendered representations (e.g. in what ways are males and females written or spoken about). Additionally, the book shows ways that readers can either explore their own hypotheses, or approach the corpus from a "nai;ve" position, letting the data drive their analysis from the outset. The book covers a range of techniques and measures including frequencies, keywords, collocations, dispersion, word sketches, downsizing and triangulation, all in an accessible style"--},

What is a collocational network or a key cluster? Introducing the major techniques, methods and tools for corpus-assisted analysis of discourse, this book answers these questions and more, showing readers how to best use corpora in their analyses of discourse. Using carefully tailored case studies, each chapter is devoted to a central technique, including frequency, concordancing and keywords, going step by step through the process of applying different analytical procedures. Introducing a wide range of different corpora, from holiday brochures to political debates, the book considers the key debates and latest advances in the field. Fully revised and updated, this new edition includes: - A new chapter on how to conduct research projects in corpus-based discourse analysis - Completely rewritten chapters on collocation and advanced techniques, using a corpus of jihadist propaganda texts and covering topics such as social media and visual analysis - Coverage of major tools, including CQPweb, AntConc, Sketch Engine and \#LancsBox - Discussion of newer techniques including the derivation of lockwords and the comparison of multiple data sets for diachronic analysis With exercises, discussion questions and suggested further readings in each chapter, this book is an excellent guide to using corpus linguistics techniques to carry out discourse analysis},

We identified, in the analysis of dialogual contexts: i) values within the epistemic modality (possibility, probability, doubt and certainty), derived from a source meaning (ability) associated with agent-oriented modality, and ii) other expressions of subjectivity as surprise, irony and joy. The control of frequency enabled us to sketch patterns of the use of capaz: the item is more recurrent in contexts of certainty (in affirmative and negative responses) and doubt/surprise, appearing predominantly as a syntactically autonomous item with a function of discourse marker. The nature of the information given by the interlocutor (question, opinion, fact/news) as well as the prosodic aspects that involve the item are decisive for the interpretation of the meaning of capaz.},

  abstract = {A battlement,  in defensive architecture, such as that of city walls or castles, comprises a parapet (a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height), in which gaps or indentations, which are often rectangular, occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences. These gaps are termed embrasures, also known as crenels or crenelles, and a wall or building with them is described as crenellated; alternative older terms are castellated and embattled.  The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation.  The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them part of the parapet to hide behind, from which they can quickly expose themselves to launch projectiles, then retreat behind the parapet. A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements, or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements, where no parapet previously existed, or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall.  A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers, and often the tops of lower walls.  These are essentially decorative rather than functional, as are many examples on secular buildings. The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons. Battlements on walls have protected walkways, termed chemin de ronde behind them.  On tower or building tops, the often flat roof is used as a protected fighting platform.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper examines the context of scholarly knowledge production and dissemination in Brazil by comparing the publishing practices in both Portuguese and in English of Brazilian scholars who hold a research grant, across eight fields of knowledge. Data consists of 1,874 Curricula Vitae and the analysis focused on the language, number, and genres of publications over a three-year period (2014 to 2016). The study revealed a clear contrast regarding the more frequent use of English by researchers in the `harder' sciences and the preference for Portuguese by those in the `softer' sciences. The results also suggested an interconnection in which scholars who published the most tended to adopt English. Multiple factors involved in the genre and language choices made by academics were analysed, such as characteristics of the work produced by each disciplinary community, the audience of the research, the type of language used, and the need to obtain research funding. This investigation can potentially inform policies and investments in Brazilian higher education and research to provide continued support specific to the needs of different disciplinary communities, as well as foster the inclusion of multilingual scholars who do not have English as their first language in the global arena of knowledge production and dissemination.},

At this level, words and grammatical structures are not seen as independent, but rather mutually dependent, with one level interfacing with the other. This entry focuses on systemic functional linguistics (SFL) and corpus linguistics (CL), because these two theoretical-methodological frameworks have close ties to applied linguistics, and in both of them lexicogrammar plays a central role. Lexicogrammar has been studied in various ways, through such notions as collocation, colligation, phraseology, lexical pattern, chunk, lexical bundle, formulaic language, and lexical frame, among others. The separation between lexis and grammar has been one of the cornerstones of linguistic scholarship, being incarnated in the dictionary and grammar, the two main reference points for language study. However, systemic functional linguistics and corpus linguistics, each in its own way, reunite these two levels, and, despite some divergence, advocate the uninterrupted continuity between and/or fusion of lexis and grammar.},

At the same time, a large body of literature on text varieties in Brazilian Portuguese exists, but previous research focusses on specific aspects of one, or at the most, a few varieties at a time and, therefore, does not present a comprehensive picture of register use in the linguistic community of Brazilian Portuguese speakers. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap by employing the MD framework, enabling researchers to account for a large number of different registers, based on a wide repertory of linguistic features. The analysis revealed six dimensions of variation, which are presented, illustrated and discussed here.},

A defining feature of multimodal corpora is the alignment of diverse data streams---such as video, audio, speech transcriptions, and annotations of gesture, prosody, and spatial relations---which together can offer a rich understanding of communication. By incorporating multimodality, DDL shifts from an exclusive focus on written text to a broader range of semiotic resources, thereby enabling learners to observe language use in authentic, real-world contexts. In this way, multimodal DDL supports contextually grounded language learning and allows for the development of language skills based on multiple modes, including speech, visual cues, and body language. The entry also addresses the practical and methodological challenges of building multimodal corpora, including the interpretive nature of transcription, the variable depth of annotation, and the need for tools to support data collection and analysis. It discusses the use of concordances---both form- and meaning-oriented---as a means of analysing multimodal data, each with distinct implications for analytical depth and time investment. Finally, the entry compares the use of ready-made versus custom-built multimodal corpora, weighing the trade-offs between accessibility and pedagogical relevance, and shows how recent advances in artificial intelligence can assist teachers with little technical expertise in constructing and annotating their own multimodal corpora.},

  abstract = {In many studies, grammatical complexity has been treated as a single unified construct. However, other research contradicts that view, suggesting instead that the different structural types and syntactic functions of complexity features are distributed in texts in fundamentally different ways. These patterns have been documented in general corpora that include a wide range of spoken and written registers. One question that has not been fully addressed is whether grammatical complexity features are organized in the same ways in the spoken versus written modes. The present study tests the empirical adequacy of four competing models based on different theoretical conceptualizations of text complexity, comparing their goodness-of-fit in spoken versus written modes. The results show that text complexity must be treated as a multi-dimensional construct; dimensions that combine structural type and syntactic function provide the best account of the actual patterns of linguistic co-occurrence. To a large extent, the same complexity dimensions operate in both the spoken and written modes. Two of these dimensions---dependent phrases functioning as noun modifiers and finite dependent clauses functioning as clause-level constituents---represent the strongest co-occurrence patterns. In addition, these two dimensions operate in complementary distribution, in both the spoken and written modes. Overall, though, these two dimensions are shown to represent stronger co-occurrence patterns in the written mode than in the spoken mode.},

Biber and Gray tackle the nature of grammatical complexity, demonstrating that embedded phrasal structures are as important as embedded dependent clauses. The authors also overturn ingrained assumptions about linguistic change, showing that grammatical change occurs in writing as well as speech. This work establishes that academic writing is structurally compressed (rather than elaborated); that it is often not explicit in the expression of meaning; and that scientific academic writing has been the locus of some of the most important grammatical changes in English over the past 200 years (rather than being conservative and resistant to change). Supported throughout with textual evidence, this work is essential reading for discourse analysts, sociolinguists, applied linguists, as well as descriptive linguists and historical linguists.},

  abstract = {Abstract              Corpus-based methods for the quantitative linguistic description of registers are well established. In contrast, situational analyses of registers have been based on qualitative descriptions of categorical situational characteristics. In the present study, we address this inconsistency by describing the variation among texts and registers in a continuous (quantitative) situational space. We describe ``registers'' as categorical constructs -- culturally recognized categories of texts -- but propose that they should be described in continuous terms. Such descriptions allow quantitative comparisons of registers, as well as analysis of the extent to which a register is well-delimited in terms of its situational characteristics.                              Applying this analytical framework, we also explore a deeper issue: the possibility that some texts are not instantiations of any culturally-recognized register category. Both issues are tackled through analysis of a corpus of web documents. We first identify quantitative situational dimensions of variation, employing the methods of multi-dimensional (MD) analysis. We then describe how the situational characteristics of texts and registers can be analyzed in a continuous MD space. And finally, we propose analysis of                situational text types                -- categories that are statistically well-defined in their situational characteristics -- as an approach to describing all texts, including texts that do not belong to a culturally recognized register category.},

The book traces the development of the RF approach from its foundations in two major research strands of linguistics: the study of sociolinguistic variation and the text-linguistic study of register variation. Building on this foundation, the editors demonstrate the RF framework at work across a series of corpus-based research studies focused specifically on grammatical complexity in English. The volume highlights early work exploring patterns of grammatical complexity in present-day spoken and written registers as well as subsequent studies which extend this research to historical patterns of register variation and the application of RF research to the study of writing development for L1 and L2 English university students. Taken together, along with the addition of introductory chapters connecting the different studies, the volume offers readers with a comprehensive resource to better understand the RF approach to grammatical complexity and its implications for future research. The volume will appeal to students and scholars with research interests in either descriptive linguistics or applied linguistics, especially those interested in grammatical complexity and empirical, corpus-based approaches"--},

However, previous conceptualizations of register cannot adequately account for empirical                     findings which have revealed (i) situational and linguistic variation among texts within registers and (ii) texts that do not                     belong to a register. We propose an alternative conceptualization in which registers are culturally-recognized categories, as                     opposed to scientifically-defined categories. This allows us to describe registers for their typical characteristics as well as                     the variation among texts within register categories. It also allows us to account for the functional correspondence of texts that                     exist outside of register categories.},

In Brazil, millions of people interact in social media, on a daily basis, by editing, sharing, reading and reacting to a great variety of graphic texts, videos, photos, and songs that reflect their everyday relationships, namely, they produce internet memes. This study is grounded on the multiliteracies perspective (COPE \& KALANTZIS, 2000, 2008; LANKSHEAR \& KNOBEL, 2007; LEMKE, 2009; MENEZES DE SOUZA, 2011), as well as on the studies on memes, made by Dawkins (1976), Shifman (2013, 2014), Shifman et al (2016), Chagas (2017, 2018) and Glaveanu (2018). The teaching suggestions are based on categories of memes analysis; remixing existing memes in order to explore discourses of dominant ideologies, issues of race, age, gender and social class; and reading and writing political memes, that operate as instruments of persuasion.},

The play takes place in the Irish Midlands in an unspecified time in the modern era. It is loosely based on the Greek myth Medea. In this myth, the sorceress Medea marries the hero Jason and has two children with him. When Jason leaves her for another woman, Medea kills their children, Jason's new bride, and the bride's father. By the Bog of Cats contains many mystical and mythical elements, including ghosts, curses, and references to witchcraft. It includes themes of land ownership, motherhood, betrayal/abandonment, and ethnic prejudice.},

  abstract = {The rapid emergence of generative AI models in the media sector demands a critical examination of the narratives these models produce, particularly in relation to sensitive topics, such as politics, racism, immigration, public health, gender and violence, among others. The ease with which generative AI can produce narratives on sensitive topics raises concerns about potential harms, such as amplifying biases or spreading misinformation. Our study juxtaposes the content generated by a state-of-the-art generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-4, with actual articles from leading UK media outlets on the topic of immigration. Our specific case study focusses on the representation of Eastern European Roma migrants in the context of the 2016 UK Referendum on EU membership. Through a comparative critical discourse analysis, we uncover patterns of representation, inherent biases and potential discrepancies in representation between AI-generated narratives and mainstream media discourse with different political views. Preliminary findings suggest that ChatGPT-4 exhibits a remarkable degree of objectivity in its reporting and demonstrates heightened racial awareness in the content it produces. Moreover, it appears to consistently prioritise factual accuracy over sensationalism. All these features set it apart from right-wing media articles in our sample. This is further evidenced by the fact that, in most instances, ChatGPT-4 refrains from generating text or does so only after considerable adjustments when prompted with headlines that the model deems inflammatory. While these features can be attributed to the model's diverse training data and model architecture, the findings invite further examination to determine the full scope of ChatGPT-4's capabilities and its potential shortcomings in representing the full spectrum of social and political perspectives prevalent in society.},

Based on the principles of the Anthropology of Enunciation, as Flores1 proposes, the analytical gesture carried out assumes linguistics as knowledge about man in his loquens property, specifically at the moment in which one singularizes in/through discourse.}

Focussing on the website of the UK's largest dairy company, Arla Foods UK, the analysis interrogates both linguistic and visual choices in representing dairy farmers, dairy cows and the process of dairy farming itself. The analysis demonstrates how recurrent representations function to construct a decidedly favourable image of the dairy industry, which often diverges significantly from the more complex and less palatable realities of dairy production. In particular, the website evidences a range of discursive choices which serve to recontextualise dairy farming, including the anthropomorphising of cows, the portrayal of farms as bucolic idylls, and the omission of less favourable aspects of the process (e.g., its environmental impacts and animal welfare issues). These representational strategies are designed, we argue, to align consumer perceptions with a sanitised version of dairy production, facilitating continued consumption under the guise of ethical engagement. Viewed through the lens of Critical Animal Studies, the public discourse that emerges from the website is argued to be one which serves the ideological and commercial interests of dairy industry actors, by obscuring the intensive and industrial reality of modern dairy farming, all the while constructing an (idealised) image of sustainability and animal care.},

We critically evaluate the utility of the thematic grouping of texts into `topics' emerging from a large collection of online patient comments about the National Health Service (NHS) in England. We take two approaches to this, one inspired by methods adopted in existing topic modelling research and the other using more established methods of discourse analysis. In the study, we compare the insights produced by each approach and consider the extent to which the automatically generated topics might be of use to discourse analysts attempting to organise and study sizeable datasets. We found that the topic modelling approach was able to group texts into `topics' that were truly thematically coherent with a mixed degree of success, while the more traditional approach to discourse analysis consistently provided a more nuanced perspective on the data which was ultimately closer to the `reality' of the texts it contains. This study thus highlights issues concerning the use of topic modelling and offers recommendations and caveats to researchers employing such approaches to studying discourse in the future.},

We subjected ChatGPT to 12 of these experiments, pre-registered and with 1,000 runs per experiment. In 10 of them, ChatGPT replicated the human pattern of language use. It associated unfamiliar words with different meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures, reinterpreted implausible sentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, glossed over errors, drew reasonable inferences, associated causality with different discourse entities according to verb semantics, and accessed different meanings and retrieved different words depending on the identity of its interlocutor. However, unlike humans, it did not prefer using shorter words to convey less informative content and it did not use context to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities. We discuss how these convergences and divergences may occur in the transformer architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT are capable of mimicking human language processing to a great extent, and that they have the potential to provide insights into how people learn and use language.},

  abstract = {"Metaphor is recognised as an important way of thinking - constructing analogies and making connections between ideas - and an important way of using language to explain abstract ideas or to find indirect but powerful ways of conveying feelings. By investigating people's use of metaphors, we can better understand their emotions, attitudes and conceptualisations, as individuals and as participants in social life. This book describes practice in the analysis of metaphor in real-world discourse. When real-world language use is taken as the site of metaphor study, researchers face methodological issues that have only recently begun to be addressed. The contributors to this volume have all had to find ways to deal with methodological issues in their own research and have developed techniques that are brought together here. Using as a basis the discourse dynamics approach to metaphor developed by the editor, the book explores links between theory and empirical investigation, exemplifies data analysis and discusses issues in research design and practice. Particular attention is paid to the processes of metaphor identification, categorisation and labelling, and to the use of corpus linguistic and other computer-assisted methods."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {"Chandelier" is a song by Australian singer and songwriter Sia, from her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear (2014). Written by Sia and Jesse Shatkin and produced by Shatkin and Greg Kurstin, the song was released on 17 March 2014 as the lead single from the album. It is an electropop song, featuring electronica, R\&B and reggae influences. Lyrically, the song has a melancholic theme, detailing the demoralisation and rationalisation of alcoholism through the thought process of a "party girl".  More broadly, the song speaks to the fleeting feelings of release and abandon that come with intoxication, as well as the pain, guilt and emptiness that accompany addiction, alcoholism and hedonistic excess. The single received critical acclaim and reached the top 5 on record charts in 20 countries including France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the single peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sia's first single as a lead artist to appear on the Hot 100, and has sold over 2 million copies in the country. The song received 4 nominations at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance, with its video receiving a nomination for Best Music Video. A music video for the song, directed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and choreographed by Ryan Heffington, features American dancer Maddie Ziegler. It has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 billion times. In support of the single and 1000 Forms of Fear, Sia, often with Ziegler, performed "Chandelier" on a number of US television shows, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Saturday Night Live, Dancing With the Stars, and at the 57th Grammy Awards.},

  abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs.},

These dimensions are then interpreted in terms of the discourses           to which they contribute within the data, thus forming the basis of a corpus-assisted discourse analysis. The approach is demonstrated           through analysis of the discourses that are used to represent Muslims and Islam in a corpus of UK national newspaper articles published on           these topics spanning 2010--2019. The approach reveals an interaction between discourse and subregister, hence this article argues for the           need for (corpus-assisted) discourse analysts to account for subregister as a level of meaningful variation when analysing press           discourse.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the scope of Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the perspective of a multimodal grammar. Its focal point is Generative AI, a technology that puts so-called Large Language Models to work. The first part of the paper analyzes Generative AI, based as it is on the statistical probability of one token (a word or part of a word) following another. If the relation of tokens is meaningful, this is circumstantial and no more, because its mechanisms of statistical analysis eschew any theory of meaning. This is the case not only for the written text that Generative AI leverages, but by extension image and multimodal forms of meaning that it can generate. The AI can only work with non-textual forms of meaning after applying language labels, and to that extent is captive not only to the limits of probabilistic statistics but the limits of written language as well. While acknowledging gains arising from the brute statistical power of Generative AI, in its second part the paper goes on to map what is lost in its statistical and text-bound approaches to multimodal meaning-making. Our measure of these gains and losses is guided by the concept of grammar, defined here as a theory of the elemental patterns of meaning in the world---not just written text and speech, but also image, space, object, body, and sound. Ironically, a good deal of what is lost by Generative AI is computable. The third and final part of the paper briefly discusses educational applications of Generative AI. Given both its power and intrinsic limitations, we have been experimenting with the application of Generative AI in educational settings and the ways it might be put to pedagogical use. How does a grammatical analysis help us to identify the scope of worthwhile application? Finally, if more of human experience is computable than can be captured in text-bound AI, how might it be possible at the level of code to create a synthesis in which grammatical and multimodal approaches complement Generative AI?},

The emergence of ubiquitous computing creates new conditions for all working as education professionals and learning as students. The key is not the logic or technical specifications of the machines. Rather it is the new ways in which meaning is created, stored, delivered and accessed. In this paper, we suggest seven moves which are characteristic of ubiquitous learning. Each explores and exploits the potentials of ubiquitous computing. None, however, is a pedagogical thought or social agenda that is new to the era of ubiquitous computing. The only difference today is that there is now no practical reason not to make each of these moves. The affordances are there, and if we can, perhaps we should. And when we do, we may discover that a new educational paradigm begins to emerge. And as new paradigms emerge, we might find they take a leading role on technological innovation.},

My position takes a chronotopic and unfinalized view of grammar, Bakhtinian notions that give crucial importance to temporal and spatial contexts in discussions about linguistic development-expansion and historicity of language use. I take a modular perspective and focus on a pragmatic component of grammar: ambiguity in discourse. Linguistic utterances that contain the phrasal verbs rip off and hot up are analyzed in the present study for their ambiguous1, double-voicing features. My aim is to underscore the importance of recognizing double-voicing as a complex discursive strategy in Afro-Caribbean creole grammar. This feature and other non-salient, zero-marked constructions remain difficult to account for using current metrics of complexity versus simplicity. I invoke insights from Bakhtin and his theory of dialogism in the hope that it can aid our analysis of plurilingualism and the cultivation of ambiguity in creole discourse.}

  abstract = {Change in scope easily ranks among the top issues that keep project managers awake at night. At the project's launch, the scope, schedule and budget are determined and then somewhere during the course of the project, someone changes the scope. This article discusses how project managers can secure more funding and time to accomplish the additional work. It begins by exploring the change document and identifies an extremely important question: Is the proposed change financially justified? It then explains how a change in project scope is actually a separate investment decision and notes that the process for evaluating whether it is financially justified is straightforward. The article explores how scope change requires an additional expenditure, will delay the project's completion and make the benefits streams delivered by that project late. It then challenges project practitioners to answer this question: Will the increase in economic benefits brought about by the scope change exceed this negative impact?},

  abstract = {In linguistics, deixis (, ) is the use of general words and phrases to refer to a specific time, place, or person in context, e.g., the words tomorrow, there, and they. Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their denoted meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases that require contextual information to be fully understood---for example, English pronouns---are deictic. Deixis is closely related to anaphora. Although this article deals primarily with deixis in spoken language, the concept is sometimes applied to written language, gestures, and communication media as well. In linguistic anthropology, deixis is treated as a particular subclass of the more general semiotic phenomenon of indexicality, a sign "pointing to" some aspect of its context of occurrence. Although this article draws examples primarily from English, deixis is believed to be a feature (to some degree) of all natural languages. The term's origin is Ancient Greek: {$\delta\varepsilon$}ῖ{$\xi\iota\varsigma$}, romanized: deixis, lit.\,'display, demonstration, or reference'. To this, Chrysippus (c. 279 -- c. 206 BCE) added the specialized meaning point of reference, which is the sense in which the term is used in contemporary linguistics.},

  abstract = {Popular music has been the object of several studies in various fields, such as Musicology (MIDDLETON, 1993; MOORE, 2021), Cultural Studies (WALL, 2013), Sociology (BENNETT, 2008), Semiotics (DUNBAR-HALL, 1991), and Corpus Linguistics (BARBOSA, 2012; B{\'E}RTOLI DUTRA, 2010; BERTOLI-DUTRA, 2014; DELFINO, 2016; WERNER, 2012), among others. While there is great interest in the study of popular music, there are at least four general trends in the literature relevant to the present thesis. The first is the small number of empirical research on musical language, as there is a predominance of works of a theoretical nature. The second is reductionism, that is, the disconnection of the verbal component (the lyrics of songs) from the acoustic component (the melody). The third trend, among empirical studies, concerns the use of reduced data samples, formed by a few songs, which reduces the scope of the study and therefore the possibility of generalizing the results. Finally, the fourth trend is the correlation between the verbal and the acoustic modes of the songs. There are therefore four significant gaps in the previous literature, one concerning the scarcity of empirical studies, a second concerning the scarcity of studies involving both the verbal and acoustic components. The third concerning the scarcity of studies based on large data samples, and the last concerning the lack of a musical correlation that takes into account the linguistic characteristics of lyrics and the acoustic characteristics of musical production simultaneously. In view of these gaps, the present thesis aims at performing two multidimensional analyses, namely: a semantic analysis (verbal mode) and an acoustic analysis (acoustic mode), so that each song is measured along several dimensions simultaneously; another goal is to compute the correlation between the verbal and the acoustic modes through a canonical correlation analysis, a statistical procedure that relates canonical pairs of measurement sets, in this case the scores of each song on each of the semantic and acoustic dimensions. This correlation enabled the extraction of three multimodal musical dimensions: Dimension 1 - Musicality based on repetitive, vibrant rhythm, focused on bodily expression indoors, in conventional tempo, with a predominance of vocalization and verbosity, portraying the discourse of glorifying and/or criticizing materialism, wealth, luxury, ostentation futility, opulence, instant gratification, superficiality, appearance, the banal, the ephemeral, distancing itself from the supernatural, mystical, metaphysical, figurative, lyrical, poetic, transcendent (Musicality for dancing portraying the concrete materialist discourse and distancing itself from the xi mystical); Musical Dimension 2 - Musicality based on intensity, amplified instrumentation, extroversion, vigorous, powerful vocalization, with high volume, strength and fast movement, in accelerated rhythm, aimed primarily at engaging with the audience in live performance, with subjectivist discourse on the existence of the 'other', accounts of personal and interpersonal dramas resulting from suffering due to the impossibility of knowing the intimacy of the other, problems of communication and mutual understanding, description of internal mental processes, describing the world as supernatural, mystical, metaphysical, figurative, lyrical, poetic, transcendent (Intense musicality depicting the discourse of personal drama and the supernatural); Musical Dimension 3 - Musicality based on happier chords and higher tones, with a less emotional and less moody sound portraying the tragic-romantic discourse of the personal journey, the search for happiness and love, suffering through loneliness, reunion, the myth of the ideal home, love as a journey, the ceaseless search for happiness (Joyful musicality portraying the tragic-romantic discourse)},

To do so, the article reviews the definition, theoretical choices, characteristics, and modular structure of a didactic sequence, comparing this procedure to the concept of a dialectic methodology of knowledge construction in the classroom, and presents a brief analysis of a didactic sequence plan.            ,               Resumo: Em cursos de forma{\c c}{\~a}o inicial e cont{\'i}nua de professores de l{\'i}nguas materna e adicional no Brasil, o conceito de sequ{\^e}ncia did{\'a}tica tem sido amplamente estudado como um procedimento te{\'o}rico e metodol{\'o}gico para o ensino e a aprendizagem de l{\'i}nguas, uma vez que se foca no trabalho com textos orais e escritos numa perspectiva de g{\^e}neros textuais.

O objetivo deste artigo {\'e} ponderar nessa dire{\c c}{\~a}o e apontar uma vis{\~a}o de pesquisa e de metodologia distanciada do cunho positivista do paradigma tradicional e que permite que tenhamos um olhar diferenciado para as viv{\^e}ncias sendo investigadas. Para tal, compartilhamos a experi{\^e}ncia de Costa Neves (2011) e D'Esposito (2012) que, ao desenvolverem suas pesquisas de doutoramento na {\'a}rea de Lingu{\'i}stica Aplicada, buscaram uma metodologia de pesquisa coaduna {\`a} perspectiva da complexidade que foi a base de desenvolvimento de suas pesquisas. Assim sendo, neste trabalho os pesquisadores apresentam o di{\'a}logo por eles estabelecido entre a complexidade (Morin, 1990/2008, 1999/2006a,b, 2005/2006; Moraes, 1997/2006; Mariotti, 2007, et alli) e a abordagem hermen{\^e}utico-fenomenol{\'o}gica (van Manen, 1990; Freire, 1998, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010).           ,              The ever-changing contemporary world requires transformations in the way we investigate classrooms, our teaching practice, and do research. The aim of this paper is to ponder about it and indicate a vision of research and methodology - apart from the positivism of the traditional paradigm - that would allow us to have a particular view of the experiences under investigation. In order to achieve this objective, in this paper we share the experiences of Costa Neves (2011) and D'Esposito (2012) who, when developing their doctorate research in the Applied Linguistics field, sought a research methodology consistent with the complexity perspective which was the basis for the development of their research. Thus, in this paper, the researchers focus on and present the dialogue established by them between complexity (Morin, 1990/2008, 1999/2006a,b, 2005/2006; Moraes, 1997/2006; Mariotti, 2007, et alli) and the hermeneutic-phenomenological approach (van Manen, 1990; Freire, 1998, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010).},

  abstract = {The objective of this research is to investigate and interpret, from the researcher-teacher-designer s perspective, two phenomena: design and implementation of a distance writing course for English for High School teachers in public schools, in S{\~a}o Paulo, designed according to the needs expressed by teachers working in this context, as well as the ones perceived in the official documents: Proposta Curricular do Estado de S{\~a}o Paulo para a disciplina de L{\'i}ngua Estrangeira Moderna (S{\~a}o Paulo, 2008) and Cadernos written by Secretaria da Educa{\c c}{\~a}o do Estado de S{\~a}o Paulo (S{\~a}o Paulo, 2008). However, this study reveals a particular way of conceiving this research and course, as complexity is its foundation (Morin, 1999/2006a,b, 1990/2008, 2005/2006, among others), establishing a dialogue with the theoretical basis, the methodological approach, the course design and its implementation. In this study, I articulate Dewey s theory of thought formation (1933/1959, 1938/1971) to Sch{\"o}n s epistemology of practice (1991, 1992, 1998/2000), studies in the writing area (Zamel, 1985,1987; Ferris, 1995,2003; Grabe \& Kaplan, 1996, among others) and online teaching (Palloff \& Pratt, 1999; Horton, 2000, Filatro, 2003, 2008, among others). To investigate the nature of a lived experience, the methodological approach chosen was the hermeneutic-phenomenological one (van Manen, 1990 and Freire, 1998, 2007, 2008a,b, 2010). In this work, I present the needs revealed by the teachers and the official documents, I describe the different phases that are part and structure the phenomena in focus and I interpret them. The interpretation, under the perspective of the teacher researcher and course designer, reveals the themes that compose the design and implementation phenomena, besides their existing interrelation. The texts reveal seven main themes in relation to the design phenomenon: questionings, exploration, research, challenges, definitions, time and fear. In relation to the implementation phenomenon, five are the main themes: exploration, questionings, definitions, transformations and fear},

It has two fundamental aspects: one, of an epistemic nature, refers to the need to de-link the concept from a particular hegemonic scholarship so that local knowledge production may prevent literacy practices from universalisms and methodologization; the other, of a technological nature, refers to the need to de-link the concept of multiliteracies from its apparent subjection to the digital.           ,              RESUMO Este trabalho almeja uma leitura cr{\'i}tica, partindo das teorias decoloniais, da proposta original dos multiletramentos.

Word lists are                     commonly developed as aids for language teaching and learning, vocabulary testing, and language description. Yet, these lists are                     often produced and used without evaluation of their stability~--- or replicability --- across corpus samples. Our primary                     objective in this paper is to describe the cumulative state of knowledge regarding the stability of corpus-based word type lists,                     focusing on three goals that motivate the creation and use of rank-ordered lists: identifying key lexical items for learning or                     teaching, assessing vocabulary size or knowledge, and identifying all items in a language domain. We show that word type lists are                     far less stable than researchers and practitioners often assume, although there is substantial variability in stability depending                     on the goals and methods behind list creation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Previous theoretical and empirical research on register variation has argued that linguistic co-occurrence patterns have a highly systematic relationship to register differences, because they both share the same functional underpinnings. The goal of this study is to test this claim through a comparison of two statistical techniques that have been used to describe register variation: factor analysis (as used in Multi-Dimensional analysis, MDA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). MDA and CDA have different statistical bases and thus give priority to different analytical considerations: linguistic co-occurrence in the case of MDA and the prediction of register differences in the case of CDA. Thus, there is no statistical reason to expect that the two techniques, if applied to the same corpus, will produce similar results. We hypothesize that although MDA and CDA approach register variation from opposite sides, they will produce similar results because both types of statistical patterns are motivated by underlying discourse functions. The present paper tests this claim through a case-study analysis of variation among web registers, applying MDA and CDA to analyze register variation in the same corpus of texts.},

By working with subcorpora that separate text within and outside of quotation marks, we appromixate fictional speech                     and narration. This enables us to identify and compare linguistic features with regard to different situational contexts in the                     fictional world. We focus in particular on the novels of Charles Dickens and a reference corpus of other 19th-century fiction. Our                     main method for the register analysis is Multi-dimensional Analysis (MDA) for which we draw on altogether four dimensions from two                     previous MDAs. The linguistic distinctions we identify highlight similarities between fictional speech and involved registers such                     as face-to-face communication, and between narration and more informational and narrative prose. In addition to the detailed                     information on register features that characterize speech and narration, the paper raises more general questions about the ability                     of register studies to deal with situational contexts within fiction.},

En estos pa{\'i}ses, los programas FID representan un 12,4\% de la matr{\'i}cula en educaci{\'o}n superior (en pa{\'i}ses de la OCDE un 8\%, y en EE.UU. menos de 1\%).

  abstract = {Abstract             The question of how generative AI tools, such as large language models and chatbots, can be leveraged ethically and effectively in education is ongoing. Given the critical role that writing plays in learning and assessment within educational institutions, it is of growing importance for educators to make thoughtful and informed decisions as to how and in what capacity generative AI tools should be leveraged to assist in the development of students' writing skills. This paper reports on two longitudinal studies. Study 1 examined learning outcomes of 48 university English as a new language (ENL) learners in a six-week long repeated measures quasi experimental design where the experimental group received writing feedback generated from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and the control group received feedback from their human tutor. Study 2 analyzed the perceptions of a different group of 43 ENLs who received feedback from both ChatGPT and their tutor. Results of study 1 showed no difference in learning outcomes between the two groups. Study 2 results revealed a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback, with clear advantages to both forms of feedback apparent from the data. The main implication of these studies is that the use of AI-generated feedback can likely be incorporated into ENL essay evaluation without affecting learning outcomes, although we recommend a blended approach that utilizes the strengths of both forms of feedback. The main contribution of this paper is in addressing generative AI as an automatic essay evaluator while incorporating learner perspectives.},

  abstract = {A proposal that we think about digital technologies such as machine learning not in terms of artificial intelligence but as artificial communication. Algorithms that work with deep learning and big data are getting so much better at doing so many things that it makes us uncomfortable. How can a device know what our favorite songs are, or what we should write in an email? Have machines become too smart? In Artificial Communication, Elena Esposito argues that drawing this sort of analogy between algorithms and human intelligence is misleading. If machines contribute to social intelligence, it will not be because they have learned how to think like us but because we have learned how to communicate with them. Esposito proposes that we think of "smart" machines not in terms of artificial intelligence but in terms of artificial communication. To do this, we need a concept of communication that can take into account the possibility that a communication partner may be not a human being but an algorithm-which is not random and is completely controlled, although not by the processes of the human mind. Esposito investigates this by examining the use of algorithms in different areas of social life. She explores the proliferation of lists (and lists of lists) online, explaining that the web works on the basis of lists to produce further lists; the use of visualization; digital profiling and algorithmic individualization, which personalize a mass medium with playlists and recommendations; and the implications of the "right to be forgotten." Finally, she considers how photographs today seem to be used to escape the present rather than to preserve a memory},

Ideological discourses (e.g., `immigrants are threats') are particularly potent structures that mediate language, cognition and social life. Whilst there has been a recent increase in studies of texts on the topic of migration generally, there are few that focus on the intersection of migration and education or on discursive patterns that transcend registers. This study introduces a multi-dimensional analysis approach for the identification of ideological discourses from a 9 million-word corpus of twenty-first century, US texts about migrant education from multiple registers (online comments, national and regional newspaper texts, and federal and state government webpages) using the distribution of lexical variables that characterise variants of migrant/ migration. Eleven ideological discourses (e.g., `US immigration policies are problematic, but there is no consensus for solutions') were found. Of these, several had not been previously identified, one confirmed a previously identified discourse, and several complemented and extended previously identified discursive patterns on this topic. Together, these findings reveal the highly naturalised ideologically discursive landscape that shapes educational opportunities for US migrant students.},

  abstract = {The fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible, imagined wall separates actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes the actors act as if they cannot. From the 16th century onward, the rise of illusionism in staging practices, which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century, led to the development of the fourth wall concept.The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-sc{\`e}ne behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, in what is known as a box set, the "fourth" of them would run along the line (technically called the "proscenium") dividing the room from the auditorium. The "fourth wall", though, is a theatrical convention, rather than of set design. The actors ignore the audience, focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world, and remain absorbed in its fiction, in a state that the theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called "public solitude" (the ability to behave as one would in private, despite, in actuality, being watched intently while so doing, or to be 'alone in public'). In this way, the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience."Breaking the fourth wall" is when this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is violated. This can be done through either directly referring to the audience, the play as a play, or the characters' fictionality. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical. A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media. Breaking the fourth wall is also possible in other media, such as video games and books.},

Her name first appeared in the second edition, which was published in Paris in 1821. Shelley travelled through Europe in 1815 along the river Rhine in Germany, stopping in Gernsheim, 17 kilometres (11 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where two centuries before, an alchemist engaged in experiments. She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. Galvanism and occult ideas were topics of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband Percy B. Shelley. In 1816, Mary, Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley was inspired to write Frankenstein after imagining a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made.Though Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement, Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story. In contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, Aldiss states that the central character "makes a deliberate decision" and "turns to modern experiments in the laboratory" to achieve fantastic results. The novel has had a considerable influence on literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films, and plays. Since the publication of the novel, the family name "Frankenstein" has often been used to refer to the monster, rather than his creator/father.},

Emphasis on these areas, although it may create a pedagogical foundation for the teacher-in-preparation, skirts the central issue of learning to teach. This article refocuses language teacher education on teaching itself by proposing two schemata: (a) a descriptive model that defines teaching as a decision-making process based on the categories of knowledge, skills, attitude, and awareness and (b) a related framework of two educating strategies-training and development-to teach teaching.},

  abstract = {Gothic fiction, sometimes called Gothic horror in the 20th century, is a genre of literature and film that covers horror, death and at times romance. It is said to derive from the English author Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, later subtitled "A Gothic Story". Early contributors included Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis. It tends to stress emotion and a pleasurable terror that expands the Romantic literature of the time. The common "pleasures" were the sublime, which indescribably "takes us beyond ourselves." Such extreme Romanticism was popular throughout Europe, especially among English and German-language authors. Its 19th-century success peaked with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and work by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Dickens, and in poetry with Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Also prominent was the later Dracula by Bram Stoker. The name Gothic spread from the Goths to mean "German". It also draws in Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages, where many of the stories occur. Twentieth-century contributors include Daphne du Maurier, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice and Toni Morrison.},

The                      present study seeks to describe linguistic variation in L2 writing for content classes and to compare these linguistic patterns to                      those found in L1 writing. A multi-dimensional (MD) analysis was conducted in two corpora, BAWE and BrAWE, extracting five                      dimensions. The L2 corpus contained 379 texts written by Brazilian students doing part of their undergrad in the UK and the L1                      corpus contained 395 texts from BAWE. The results of this study indicate that L1 and L2 writers use similar linguistic resources                      to convey the purpose of university registers, with the exception of case studies, designs, exercises and research reports. This                      linguistic variation between L1 and L2 writers might be explained by students' interpretation of these registers' communicative                      purposes.},

Comprehensive analyses include a lexical/grammatical survey, an exploration of structural complexity, and a Multi-Dimensional analysis, all interpreted relative to the situational analysis of the corpus. The finding that linguistic variation in research articles does not occur along a single parameter like discipline is discussed relative to our understanding of disciplinary practices, the multidimensional nature of variation in research articles, and resulting methodological considerations for corpus studies of disciplinary writing.},

  abstract = {Research analysing linguistic variation in research articles (RAs) across academic disciplines typically employs a relatively coarse definition of RAs: any text published in an academic journal that reports on primary research. This definition assumes that articles within a single discipline which report on distinct research methodologies are similar linguistically. Yet little empirical work has investigated this assumption. This study uses multi-dimensional analysis to analyse variation in the use of seventy lexical and grammatical features in 270 research articles representing three sub-registers (theoretical, qualitative and quantitative research reports) in six disciplines (philosophy, history, applied linguistics, political science, biology and physics). The resulting dimensions of variation indicate that linguistic variation occurs along multiple parameters, not only across disciplinary lines. For example, variation also corresponds to the differing purposes and types of evidence associated with the three research paradigms. This article explores each of these complex patterns of variation to move towards a more comprehensive understanding of language use within and across disciplines, and considers the implications of these findings for future corpus-based analyses of disciplinary variation.},

We claim that large language models are inherently models of varieties of language, and we consider how this insight can inform the development and deployment of large language models. We begin by presenting a technical definition of the concept of a variety of language as developed in sociolinguistics. We then discuss how this perspective can help address five basic challenges in language modeling: social bias, domain adaptation, alignment, language change, and scale. Ultimately, we argue that it is crucial to carefully define and compile training corpora that accurately represent the specific varieties of language being modeled to maximize the performance and societal value of large language models.},

  abstract = {Large language models and generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have gained influence over people's personal lives and work since their launch, and are expected to scale even further. While the promises of generative artificial intelligence are compelling, this technology harbors significant biases, including those related to gender. Gender biases create patterns of behavior and stereotypes that put women, men and gender-diverse people at a disadvantage. Gender inequalities and injustices affect society as a whole. As a social practice, gendering is achieved through the repeated citation of rituals, expectations and norms. Shared understandings are often captured in scripts, including those emerging in and from generative AI, which means that gendered views and gender biases get grafted back into social, political and economic life. This paper's central argument is that large language models work performatively, which means that they perpetuate and perhaps even amplify old and non-inclusive understandings of gender. Examples from ChatGPT are used here to illustrate some gender biases in AI. However, this paper also puts forward that AI can work to mitigate biases and act to `undo gender'.},

Different varieties differ in accent, vocabulary, grammar, discourse, sociolinguistics, and have its respective characteristics in pronunciation, tone, intonation, spelling and so on. Therefore, it is important for English language learners to observe the differences in language use. The present paper is an attempt to explore the regional characteristics of the two most commonly used varieties of the English Language--British English and American English. It is concluded that there will be intercommunications which will make the regional differences mild and easily understood. However, some differences may disappear, the others will remain so.}

  abstract = {This descriptive qualitative research study aims at identifying the impact of implementing a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE henceforth) in English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) courses at a public university in Colombia. About 210 students and 5 teachers composed the sample of convenience for this study. As for the research instruments, questionnaires, class observation notes, quick surveys, and teacher narratives were used to gather information related to students' perceptions and attitudes towards the use of this technology in class as well as the existing conditions for such implementation. The study shows that students feel enthusiastic and motivated towards the use of VLEs, and they suggest that all teachers should indeed include them in their lessons. Students also realized that even though they are part of a digital age in which the use of personal digital devices is commonplace, it is sometimes challenging for them to deal with some types of educational technology. On the other hand, it was found that the capacity of laboratories and computers, as well as Internet connectivity, remain as the main threats to implementing VLE. Nevertheless, when those hindrances were overcome, the technology-based learning experience turned to be satisfactory for the EFL students.},

With a growing interest in translanguaging, ELT practitioners are searching for models and creative ideas that foster a translingual environment for their learners. We have responded to this call and developed a collaborative project entitled `Creative Language Practices: Exploring Translanguaging in Pedagogical Contexts and Beyond'. The project brought together language researchers from the University of Glasgow, creative artists, and school teachers. By sharing our approach and practices, we want to promote the adoption of translingual values and guiding principles through the use of arts as a methodology for language learning and meaning-making. Instead of feeling intimidated by the complexity and difficulty of the concept of translanguaging, teachers and practitioners could adopt an arts-based pedagogy as the catalyst for creative practice that will help learners to explore their creative resources.},

  abstract = {Abstract             English for Research and Publication Purposes (ERPP) has rapidly emerged as a productive area of second language writing research as the number of academics, journals and articles has exploded across the world. In this paper we use bibliometric methods to track changes in published work in ERPP over the last 40 years. Based on all 4,354 articles on the topic in Web of Science indexed journals between 1982 and 2022, we show what research themes have been most popular and which authors, publications and source countries have been most influential. The results indicate a shift away from a focus on pedagogical issues and classroom practices towards emerging academic publishing contexts such as open access, knowledge production and collaborative learning. This maturation of the field is also revealed in the growing concern with diverse research methods, with practitioner development, and with issues in higher education. Swales, Hyland, Halliday, Flowerdew and Biber are prominent in both author and publication lists, with a greater number of specialists in academic writing after 2008. The results also show a widening researcher base and the growing importance of Asian countries, particularly China. These findings may be of interest to writing professionals working in Higher Education.},

This AI-powered large language model is able to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts, thus potentially enabling cheating and undermining literacy and critical thinking skills. This study seeks to explore the extent AI can mimic human-produced texts by comparing essays by ChatGPT and student writers. By analysing 145 essays from each group, we focus on the way writers relate to their readers with respect to the positions they advance in their texts by examining the frequency and types of engagement markers. The findings reveal that student essays are significantly richer in the quantity and variety of engagement features, producing a more interactive and persuasive discourse. The ChatGPT-generated essays exhibited fewer engagement markers, particularly questions and personal asides, indicating its limitations in building interactional arguments. We attribute the patterns in ChatGPT\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s output to the language data used to train the model and its underlying statistical algorithms. The study suggests a number of pedagogical implications for incorporating ChatGPT in writing instruction.Keywords: ChatGPT; argumentative writing; reader engagement; academic interaction},

Multi-dimensional (MD) analysis proposed by Biber was used to capture linguistic co-occurrence patterns based on a constellation of features across collected texts. The MD results show six salient linguistic patterns: (1) Involvement and interactivity; (2) Description versus Narration; (3) Expression of attitude; (4) Informational production; (5) Framing scientific claims; and (6) Expression of denial. Discourse-based interviews were then conducted with eight professional scientists to elicit their perception of MD findings concerning their reading experience and understanding of established writing conventions.

  abstract = {This paper offers a critical exploration of the arguments for the `internalization' of speech in Lev Vygotsky's cultural-historical psychology. Vygotsky's conception is predicated on the existence of three forms of speech -- `external', `egocentric', and `inner' -- and pictures a developmental process of `internalization' in which the first is transformed into the second and third. Vygotsky's case is built around the linguistic and communicative properties of these putative speech forms. The paper argues that the whole conception is informed by the `segregationist' assumptions about language that constitute what integrationists call the `language myth'. In particular, Vygotsky's view that `external speech' is `internalized' takes for granted the segregationist position that language constitutes a self-contained system which maintains its identity and integrity as between people and contexts. The paper, therefore, rejects the internalization conception and tentatively considers how the communicative phenomena discussed by Vygotsky may be treated differently if viewed from an integrational linguistic perspective. The more general implications for the validity of cultural-historical psychology are briefly examined.},

In a world-historical frame, the significance of this cannot be understated. It is a technology in which the unnatural language of code tangles with the natural language of everyday life. Its form of writing, moreover, is multimodal, able not only to write text as conventionally understood, but also to ``read'' images by matching textual labels and to ``write'' images from textual prompts. Within the scope of this peculiarly machinic writing are mathematics, actionable software procedure, and algorithm. This paper explores the consequences of Generative AI for literacy teaching and learning. In its first part, we speak theoretically and historically, suggesting that this development is perhaps as momentous for society and education as Pi Sheng's invention of moveable type and Gutenberg's printing press---and in its peculiar ways just as problematic. In the paper's second part, we go on to propose that literacy in the time of AI requires a new way to speak about itself, a revised ``grammar'' of sorts. In a third part, we discuss an application we have developed that puts Generative AI to work in support of literacy and learning. We end with some broad-brushstroke implications for education.},

To carry out this purpose, two corpora were collected: Machado de Assis's Literary Corpus (CLIMA), which comprises 9 novels and 76 short stories written by him (859,521 words), and Comparable Literary Corpus (CLIC), reference corpus constituted of 92 works by 23 writers from 1850-1910 period (3,386,037 words). Both were tagged for part-of-speech features and had their counting normalized to 1,000 words. A list of the most frequent words and lemmas from Corpus CLIMA was also compiled. Several multidimensional analyses (MDAs) were then performed to extract co-ocurrent groups of linguistic features or words and lemmas from textual variation, the so-called dimensions of functional or lexical variation (Biber, 1988; Berber Sardinha \& Veirano Pinto, 2014, 2019). Standardized scores of the dimensions were individualized by text, enabling comparative and contrasting stylistic analyses. Two additive MDAs are initially presented, which compare the work of Machado de Assis with that of writers of the period and in relation to the functional dimensions of current Brazilian Portuguese (Berber Sardinha, Kauffmann \& Acunzo, 2014a). Next, three complete MDAs were performed, two of which in the functional approach, to verify linguistic variation across the reference corpus and within the individual work of Machado de Assis, and one lexical MDA of the CLIMA corpus focused in identifying its main lexical dimensions. Additionally, a canonical correlation analysis was carried out to verify associations between the functional and lexical dimensions identified in Machado de Assis's work, leading to the emergence of three aesthetic dimensions, named "Formal introspective romanticism", "Sentimental oralized narrative", and "Dramatic representation"},

  abstract = {This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

Playful Parts are open to pedagogical interpretation and can be applied in a variety of ways to meet the needs of particular children, situations and circumstances. They can be extensively used in different settings, such as, nurseries, schools, libraries, science centres, museums and homes. We hope that Playful Parts will come to life in a variety of forms when applied to activities participated in by adults and children and that they generate new approaches to enhance the joy of teaching and learning multiliteracy skills.},

If twenty-six letters appear here, no less than forty-three missives or notes are in fact mentioned. This article first explores the materiality of letters and letter-writing (from the activity of writing to the posting and receipt of letters), and then examines Austen's use of the letter-form as a dramatic tool as well as a means of characterization. Although Austen ultimately chose a third-person narrative over the direct style of the epistolary novel, the discussion concludes by highlighting what are potential traces of epistolarity.},

  abstract = {The latest generation of LLMs can be prompted to achieve impressive zero-shot or few-shot performance in many NLP tasks. However, since performance is highly sensitive to the choice of prompts, considerable effort has been devoted to crowd-sourcing prompts or designing methods for prompt optimisation. Yet, we still lack a systematic understanding of how linguistic properties of prompts correlate with task performance. In this work, we investigate how LLMs of different sizes, pre-trained and instruction-tuned, perform on prompts that are semantically equivalent, but vary in linguistic structure. We investigate both grammatical properties such as mood, tense, aspect and modality, as well as lexico-semantic variation through the use of synonyms. Our findings contradict the common assumption that LLMs achieve optimal performance on lower perplexity prompts that reflect language use in pretraining or instruction-tuning data. Prompts transfer poorly between datasets or models, and performance cannot generally be explained by perplexity, word frequency, ambiguity or prompt length. Based on our results, we put forward a proposal for a more robust and comprehensive evaluation standard for prompting research.},

In this direction, this article sets out theoretical bases and praxis of the Engaged Multiliteracy, presenting the demand for pedagogical practices that promote the ``good living.'' For that purpose, it discusses the Freirian and Vygotskian bases in order to understand the reformulations and propositions implemented in the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies as a way of creating the Engaged Multiliteracy. Finally, this text exemplifies a didactic proposal carried out in the Digitmed Program and presents considerations and paths to be taken from the Engaged Multiliteracy, searching for possibilities of overcoming necropolitics through everybody's engagement into the understanding and transformation of oppressive conditions of living.            ,               Resumen En el actual contexto de necropol{\'i}tica (MBEMBE, 2016), en el que la decisi{\'o}n de vivir o morir est{\'a} en manos de unos, la educaci{\'o}n juega rol importante en la constituci{\'o}n de espacios para la creaci{\'o}n de posibilidades de futuro. En tal sentido, este art{\'i}culo expone las bases te{\'o}ricas y la praxis de la Multiliteracidad Comprometida. Se empieza con la presentaci{\'o}n de la necesidad de pr{\'a}cticas pedag{\'o}gicas que promuevan el ``buen vivir'' y, para ello, discute las bases de Freire y Vygotsky para comprender las reformulaciones y proposiciones implementadas en la Pedagog{\'i}a de las Multiliteracidades como forma de hacer la Multiliteracidad Comprometida. Se finaliza con el ejemplificaci{\'o}n de una propuesta did{\'a}ctica realizada en el Programa Digitmed y con consideraciones y caminos a seguir desde esa nueva perspectiva en la b{\'u}squeda de posibilidades de superaci{\'o}n de la necropol{\'i}tica a trav{\'e}s del compromiso de todos en la comprensi{\'o}n y transformaci{\'o}n de las condiciones de opresi{\'o}n.}

  abstract = {Scholars around the world are under increasing pressure to publish their research in the medium of English. However, little empirical research has explored how the global premium of English influences the academic text production of scholars working outside of English-speaking countries. This article draws on a longitudinal text-oriented ethnographic study of psychology scholars in Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, and Portugal to follow the trajectories of texts from local research and writing contexts to English-medium publications. Our findings indicate that a significant number of mediators, ``literacy brokers,'' who are involved in the production of such texts, influence the texts in different and important ways. We illustrate in broad terms the nature and extent of literacy brokering in English-medium publications and characterize and exemplify brokers' different orientations. We explore what kind of brokering is evident in the production of a specific group of English-medium publications---articles written and published in English-medium international journals---by focusing on three text histories. We conclude by discussing what a focus on brokering can tell us about practices surrounding academic knowledge production.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly smart and autonomous, targeting real-world pragmatic missions beyond traditional NLP tasks. As a result, there has been an urgent need to evaluate LLMs as agents on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional evolving benchmark that currently consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities in a multi-turn open-ended generation setting. Our extensive test over 27 API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and OSS competitors. We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents. Training on code and high quality multi-turn alignment data could improve agent performance. Datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench\}.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cultural areas represent a useful concept that cross-fertilizes diverse fields in social sciences. Knowledge of how humans organize and relate their ideas and behavior within a society can help us to understand our actions and attitudes toward different issues. However, the selection of common traits that shape a cultural area is somewhat arbitrary. What is needed is a method that can leverage the massive amounts of data coming online, especially through social media, to identify cultural regions without ad-hoc assumptions, biases, or prejudices. This work takes a crucial step in this direction by introducing a method to infer cultural regions based on the automatic analysis of large datasets from microblogging posts. The approach presented here is based on the principle that cultural affiliation can be inferred from the topics that people discuss among themselves. Specifically, regional variations in written discourse are measured in American social media. From the frequency distributions of content words in geotagged tweets, the regional hotspots of words' usage are found, and from there, principal components of regional variation are derived. Through a hierarchical clustering of the data in this lower-dimensional space, this method yields clear cultural areas and the topics of discussion that define them. It uncovers a manifest North--South separation, which is primarily influenced by the African American culture, and further contiguous (East--West) and non-contiguous divisions that provide a comprehensive picture of modern American cultural areas.},

Lumber is mainly used for construction framing, as well as finishing (floors, wall panels, window frames). Lumber has many uses beyond home building.

Lumber may be supplied either rough-sawn, or surfaced on one or more of its faces. Rough lumber is the raw material for furniture-making, and manufacture of other items requiring cutting and shaping. It is available in many species, including hardwoods and softwoods, such as white pine and red pine, because of their low cost.Finished lumber is supplied in standard sizes, mostly for the construction industry -- primarily softwood, from coniferous species, including pine, fir and spruce (collectively spruce-pine-fir), cedar, and hemlock, but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring. It is more commonly made from softwood than hardwoods, and 80\% of lumber comes from softwood.},

The discussion will be of a twofold nature: on the one hand it will focus on the need to provide Brazilian state school teachers of English involved in a continuing education programme with a context conducive to reflective practice and, on the other hand, it will focus on the effectiveness of organizing that context as discussion dyads, so as to create a collaborative set up for participants to examine their classes critically. The aim set for the participants is learning how to evaluate each other's classroom practice by looking at it as a locus of investigation and of theory (de)construction. The paper discusses the educational process evolving from the discussions by analysing the dyads' discourses (Bronckart, 1999), i.e., the linguistic discursive choices that reveal their motives when acting with a pair in order to evaluate their classroom practices critically.

O artigo discute o processo educacional resultante das discuss{\~o}es, analisando os discursos das duplas (Bronckart, 1999), isto {\'e}, as escolhas ling{\"u}{\'i}sticas discursivas que revelam seus motivos quando interagindo com um par a fim de avaliar suas pr{\'a}ticas criticamente.

  abstract = {RESUMO Este artigo procura chamar a aten{\c c}{\~a}o para um conjunto de manifesta{\c c}{\~o}es do discurso que proliferam em nosso cotidiano e que proponho agrupar sob o termo de ``enunciados aderentes'' (EA). Tais enunciados foram at{\'e} agora pouco abordados pela an{\'a}lise do discurso n{\~a}o s{\'o} porque se trata de enunciados associados a todos os tipos de objetos (uma camiseta, uma garrafa, um carro, um corpo humano...), mas tamb{\'e}m porque os linguistas preferem, em geral, estudar enunciados estritamente verbais. O estudo dos EA implica com efeito que se conteste um pressuposto profundamente enraizado segundo o qual {\'e} preciso separar rigorosamente os nomes e as coisas. Ap{\'o}s ter explicitado a rela{\c c}{\~a}o de ``ader{\^e}ncia'' entre o enunciado e seu ``suporte'', e sublinhado em que este enunciado modifica a identidade do suporte, coloco em evid{\^e}ncia diversos par{\^a}metros que conv{\^e}m levar em conta para abordar os enunciados aderentes. Em um segundo momento, analiso dois tipos de enunciados bem diferentes: de um lado, enunciados com uma visada ecol{\'o}gica (sobre uma lixeira ou um gramado), de outro lado, enunciados portados por manifestantes em agrupamentos com objetivo pol{\'i}tico.           ,              ABSTRACT This article aims at drawing attention to a wide range of discourse manifestations that proliferate around us and which I propose to group together under the term ``adherent statements''. They have so far been ignored by discourse analysis because they are associated with all kinds of objects (a T-shirt, a bottle, a car, a human body...) and we generally prefer to study purely verbal data. Indeed, the study of these adhering utterances implies challenging a deeply rooted presupposition that words and things must be rigorously separated. After explaining the ``adherence'' relationship between the utterance and its ``support'', and emphasizing how this utterance modifies the identity of this support, I highlight the various parameters that must be taken into account when dealing with these adhering utterances. Secondly, I analyze two very different types of utterances: statements with an ecological purpose (on a garbage can or on a lawn), and statements made by demonstrators at political rallies.},

  abstract = {Abstract              Registerial cartography is the activity of systematically describing the registers that make up a language --- with register in its original sense of a functional variety of a language, i.e. of the adaptation of the meaning-making resources of a language according to context of use. A register map of a language would thus show its composition of registers --- of meanings at risk in the various cultural domains that constitute a culture. This variation according to use --- register variation --- is located along the cline of instantiation between the overall meaning potential of a language operating in the context of culture and the instantiation of this meaning potential unfolding as texts in contexts of situation.              In this paper, I will report on a long-term register cartography project concerned with the analysis and description of the registers that collectively constitute the meaning potential of a language. The maps produced as part of the project are based on context in the first instance, since register variation is precisely variation according to context of use. Thus registers can be located within the map according to the ``longitude and latitude'' of context, i.e. according to the contextual parameters of field, tenor and mode. Here I will focus on a field-based map, more specifically one based on a typology of fields of activity --- a characterizations of different goings-on in context. This typology differentiates eight primary types of field of activity, `expounding', `reporting', `recreating', `sharing', `doing', `enabling', `recommending' and `exploring', and their secondary and tertiary subtypes. I will then illustrate how texts operating in contexts characterized by these different fields of activity are organized semantically in terms of logico-semantic (rhetorical) relations (based on a version of RST, Rhetorical Structure Theory), showing that different relations are ``at risk'' depending on the nature of the field of activity. I will round off the paper by discussing how field-based maps of registers have and can be used in different areas of application.},

Corpus linguistics is the study of linguistic data from a particular language or set of languages. It is a fast-moving approach to studying language, and there is still a degree of divergence in how research questions are approached using corpus data. This book uses a framework, based on the work of Karl Popper, to explore a number of fundamental issues in corpus linguistics. It critically evaluates how these issues are tackled, and proposes a set of best practices for future research. It spells out why using corpus data is valuable, what we can learn from using it, and how we may most effectively progress our understanding of language by using such data. It is essential reading for researchers and students of language in general, and of applied linguistics and English language in particular.},

It is the first large scale, corpus-based exploration of the discourse macro-structures in conversational interaction between L1 and L2 speakers, and explores three corpora to show, in spoken interaction with L1 speakers across a range of tasks, the dynamics of discourse construction. Considering factors including cultural background, task and proficiency, it characterises the repertoire of discourse functions used in these interactions and shows how they vary according to a range of variables.

Policymakers, therefore, want to better understand links between distrust of institutions and vaccine refusal. This paper reports on a case study of posts (tweets) to the social media platform Twitter (now X) collected as part of the TRAC:COVID (Trust and Communication: A Coronavirus Online Visual Dashboard) project. The TRAC:COVID dashboard combines methods from corpus linguistics with various visualization techniques to enable users to explore approximately 84 million posts containing reference to COVID-19 published between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021 (encompassing the dates of UK coronavirus lockdowns). The dashboard and all sampling considerations (including an overview of the detailed search query used) are available at               https://www.traccovid.com               . Specifically, the paper analyses a subsample of posts that make reference to vaccines and contain at least one hashtag relating to various categories of dis/misinformation. By employing keyword co-occurrence analysis~-- a method for examining statistically significant keywords using multiple correspondence analysis~-- we find that these posts draw on various ``discourses of liberty'' to protest against perceived infringements on ``health freedoms'' through the imposition of new norms of behaviour (e.g., mask-wearing).},

  abstract = {Medea (Ancient Greek: {$M\acute{\eta}\delta\varepsilon\iota\alpha$}, M{\=e}deia) is an ancient Greek tragedy written by Euripides, based upon the myth of Jason and Medea and first produced in 431 BC. The plot centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the kingdom of Colchis, and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves her for a Greek princess of Corinth. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering his new wife as well as her own two sons, after which she escapes to Athens to start a new life. Euripides' play has been explored and interpreted by playwrights across the centuries and the world in a variety of ways, offering political, psychoanalytical, feminist, among many other original readings of Medea, Jason and the core themes of the play.Medea, along with three other plays, earned Euripides third prize in the City Dionysia. Some believe that this indicates a poor reception, but "the competition that year was extraordinarily keen"; Sophocles, often winning first prize, came second. The play was rediscovered with Rome's Augustan drama; again in the 16th-century; then remained part of the tragedic repertoire, becoming a classic of the Western canon, and the most frequently performed Greek tragedy in the 20th century. It experienced renewed interest in the feminist movement of the late 20th century, being interpreted as a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Medea's struggle to take charge of her own life in a male-dominated world. The play holds the American Theatre Wing's Tony Award record for most wins for the same female lead character, with Judith Anderson winning in 1948, Zoe Caldwell in 1982, and Diana Rigg in 1994.},

The Midland region spans 6,524 km2, 9.5\% of the total area of the state and according to the 2016 census has a population of 292,301.Before 2014, the region was governed by the Midlands Regional Authority. The Authority was abolished in 2014. Midland now exists as a strategic planning area within the Eastern and Midland Region. The NUTS regions are used for statistical reporting to Eurostat, while the Regional Assemblies are responsible for planning at a local government level. The Midland Region is also a tourist destination due to its natural environment which includes lakes, waterways and canals, as well as a history, heritage and culture which dates from early Christian times.},

  abstract = {A midlife crisis is a transition of identity and self-confidence that can occur in middle-aged individuals, typically 45 to 65 years old. The phenomenon is described as a psychological crisis brought about by events that highlight a person's growing age, inevitable mortality, and possibly lack of accomplishments in life.  This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety, or the desire to achieve youthfulness or make drastic changes to their current lifestyle or feel the wish to change past decisions and events. Studies on midlife crises show that they are less common than popularly believed, according to Vaillant (2012) in his 75-year longitudinal study on adult development, he found midlife crises were rare experiences for people involved in the study. The term was coined by Elliott Jaques in 1965.},

  abstract = {The internationalization of academic production has changed the publishing culture in all corners of the world with increasing participation of scholars from semi-peripheral countries in international journals (Belcher, 2007). While there has been growing interest in how multilingual scholars see this internationalization process, little is known about Brazil. To address this gap, a survey was distributed to scholars (N = 290) from different research fields in this country. The analysis of the data revealed important disciplinary differences, suggesting the existence of a peripheral group of scholars inside this semi-peripheral country. The scholars from the exact and biological sciences reported that they publish in English much more frequently than Portuguese, and few reported language-related issues. They contested the existence of a nativeness bias, although some perceived prejudice against Latin-American research. Scholars from the humanities and the social sciences publish substantially less in international journals, reporting challenges particularly with language. Overall, the data suggest that international publication has become part of the disciplinary culture in Brazil in the hard sciences while the humanities and the social sciences seem to remain in a peripheral position. This appears to be particularly true for disciplines such as education and language and literature.},

Abstract: This article aims to defend the dialogical nature of the landscape. Working in between the borders of the Bakhtinian philosophy of language and cultural studies on landscape, we defend that landscape study should not be studied without considering the cultural forms of communication in the different domains of social organization-- the speech genres; that landscape is a semiotic encounter with a concrete otherness; that the interpreter who emerges when an area enters a relationship of representation is necessarily characterized as a chronotope; that every landscape is a chronotopic representation; that cultural geography recognizes that the semiotic aspects of the landscape are as material as its morphology. We start from the hypothesis that landscape is a chronotopic representation that is always made possible by means of some speech genre, because it is always a communicative process, and an encounter with another in a situation of socially organized interrelation -- it is concrete dialogue. To find the deeper meaning of a landscape, one must recognize and understand its material, historical, geographical, and dialogic nature.}

The paper illustrates its use in the exploration of a corpus of academic English. It first offers the intuitive explanation of the underlying mechanism of topic modelling and describes the procedure for building a model, including the decisions involved in the model-building process. The paper then explores the model. A topic in topic models is characterised by a set of co-occurring words, and we will demonstrate that such topics bring us rich insights into the nature of a corpus. As exemplary tasks, this paper identifies the prominent topics in different parts of papers, investigates the chronological change of a journal, and reveals different types of papers in the journal. The paper further compares topic modelling to two more traditional techniques in corpus linguistics, semantic annotation and keywords analysis, and highlights the strengths of topic modelling. We believe that topic modelling is particularly useful in the initial exploration of a corpus.},

  abstract = {"If you're woke, you're left. If you're left, you're woke. We blur the terms, assuming that if you're one you must be the other. That, Susan Neiman argues, is a dangerous mistake. The intellectual roots and resources of wokeism conflict with ideas that have guided the left for more than 200 years: a commitment to universalism, a firm distinction between justice and power, and a belief in the possibility of progress. Without these ideas, Neiman argues, they will continue to undermine their own goals and drift, inexorably and unintentionally, towards the right. In the long run, they risk becoming what they despise. One of the world's leading philosophical voices, Neiman makes this case by tracing the malign influence of two titans of twentieth-century thought, Michel Foucault and Carl Schmitt, whose work undermined ideas of justice and progress and portrayed social life as an eternal struggle of us against them. A generation schooled with these voices in their heads, raised in a broader culture shaped by the ruthless ideas of neoliberalism and evolutionary psychology, has set about changing the world. It's time they thought again."--},

This study was thus designed to explore the relation between language and culture by examining anecdotes involving cultural conflicts collected from Brazilians in an English-speaking country. Here we analyze four (out of seven) questionnaires, for which respondent answers unexpectedly related culture to linguistic issues, such as pronunciation, intonation, grammar, and vocabulary. We then selected, from some textbooks, the linguistic categories detected in the anecdotes, aiming to verify whether there are cultural aspects involved in the way these linguistic issues are presented. Our results suggest how the inseparability of language and culture could be explored in classroom when teaching language structure and pronunciation.}

The new edition updates all core chapters and includes new chapters on corpus linguistics and statistics, digital humanities, translation, phonetics and phonology, second language acquisition, social media and theoretical perspectives. Chapters provide annotated further reading lists and step-by-step guides as well as detailed overviews across a wide range of themes. The Handbook also includes a wealth of case studies that draw on some of the many new corpora and corpus tools that have emerged in the last decade. Organised across four themes, moving from the basic start-up topics such as corpus building and design to analysis, application and reflection, this second edition remains a crucial point of reference for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and scholars in Applied Linguistics"--},

  abstract = {The main objective of this work is to compare two theme / topic / discourse modeling methods from a corpus perspective, namely, Lexical Multidimensional Analysis (LMDA) and Topic Modeling (TM). The comparison is based on a range of different corpora, namely: a corpus consisting of 1,000 academic articles written in English (CAPO - Corpus of Articles from PLOS ONE), three corpora in English (the Sally Mann Corpus; the Children Culture Corpus -- CHICC; and the Corpus of Religious and Dogmatic English Language Texts - CReDELT), in addition to a corpus of Portuguese (Corpus of Ethnic-Racial Records - CRER). As mentioned, we used Lexical Multidimensional Analysis as a means to detect the major dimensions of lexical variation, identified through the interpretation of the semantic fields underlying the co-occurrence of the most salient lexis. This framework was developed by Berber Sardinha (2016, 2017, 2019, 2021) based on the framework developed by Biber in the 1980s (Biber, 1988) for the analysis of register variation. In addition to Lexical MD Analysis, in this project we used Topic Modeling (TM), which consists of identifying sets of words commonly occurring across texts as a means to detect the major `topics' in a text collection. The central works of the area, with relevance for this study are Blei; NG; Jordan (2003) and Srinivasa-Desikan (2018). Although previous research exists for Lexical MD Analysis (e.g. Berber Sardinha (2017, 2021) and for Topic Modeling (e.g. Griffiths and Mark Steyvers, 2004; Wang and Blei, 2011 Younus et al., 2014; Murakami et al., 201; and Krasnov, 2018), no previous research exists that compares and contrasts the results of these two frameworks, despite the fact that both are used for similar purposes in the literature. Thus, this dissertation seeks to make an original contribution by comparing and contrasting these two methods},

  abstract = {Lexical bundles refer to a sequence of three to four words that recur frequently in corpus-based discourse, both written and verbal. The overt instruction of these often overlooked multi-word sequences can address specific difficulties that L2 writers struggle with in establishing a credible English academic voice in their writing and speaking. Pedagogical approaches to encourage students to use them as a part of their own writing repertoire include raising their awareness of how lexical bundles are used and scaffolding communicative exercises to practice their usage. Lexical bundles of three to four words that recur frequently in speech or writing are identified empirically in corpus-based frequency patterns (Biber, 2006). Unlike other multi-word sequences or formulaic expressions that have been identified and studied by researchers, lexical bundles are not complete grammatical units and are not idiomatic in meaning. Nevertheless, because they are so common and perform definable discourse functions, it stands to reason that they are essential to the writing and the comprehension of academic prose. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the essential role of lexical bundles in academic writing and to explore strategies to enable second language (L2) students to expand their repertoire of academic rhetorical features to include these multi-word sequences. The exploration will be guided by three principle areas of research into L2 writing: namely the sociocultural context within which L2 writers are expected to perform, the assessment of L2 writing which inevitably looks at the common errors that students make and the writing processes involved in successful composition (Weissberg, 2005).},

These publishers also provide a home for conspiracy theorists and pseudoscience promoters, as their lack of scrutiny offers fraudulent academic research articles a veneer of scholarly credibility. While most predatory journals were designed to dupe researchers, the fraudulent articles they often publish are designed to be found by members of the public, and their accessibility ensures that unlike legitimate research, they are likely to be employed as evidence by those seeking evidence. While studies have examined the common features of predatory journals, their emails, and their websites, this essay situates fraudulent academic articles in posttruth discourse, offers a taxonomy of illegitimate research articles, and highlights their common rhetorical features, in the hopes that the concepts discovered here can further contribute to pedagogy and public understanding.},

A compass rose is primarily composed of four cardinal directions---north, east, south, and west---each separated by 90 degrees, and secondarily divided by four ordinal (intercardinal) directions---northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest---each located halfway between two cardinal directions. Some disciplines such as meteorology and navigation further divide the compass with additional azimuths. Within European tradition, a fully defined compass has 32 'points' (and any finer subdivisions are described in fractions of points).Compass points are valuable in that they allow a user to refer to a specific azimuth in a colloquial fashion, without having to compute or remember degrees.},

  abstract = {O objetivo desta tese {\'e} descrever e interpretar o fen{\^o}meno do processo reflexivo de coordenadores em um curso online de forma{\c c}{\~a}o continuada, considerando para isso a perspectiva de quem o vivenciou: o professor-pesquisador e os coordenadores, alunos de um curso, denominado e-ducation. A fundamenta{\c c}{\~a}o te{\'o}rica deste estudo est{\'a} ancorada em: (a) uma vis{\~a}o sobre forma{\c c}{\~a}o de professores que ressalta a import{\^a}ncia do desenvolvimento da sua capacidade cr{\'i}tico-reflexiva, tomando-se como base as contribui{\c c}{\~o}es de Dewey (1916/1994, 1938/1967), Sch{\"o}n (1987, 1991, 1992), Almeida (2005-2006), Kincheloe (1993/1997), N{\'o}voa (1995), Perrenoud (2002), Pimenta (2002), Popkewitz (1995), Sacrist{\'a}n (2002), Webb (1996) e Zeichner (1992); (b) um entendimento da aprendizagem como sendo socialmente constituida, pass{\'i}vel de ser constru{\'i}da em comunidades, e de se formar tendo como base elementos presentes em nosso cotidiano, conforme discutido por Vygotsky (1934/1984, 1937/1987), Lave \&Wenger (1991) e Popper (1972); (c) uma compreens{\~a}o da linguagem sob uma perspectiva p{\'o}s-moderna que entende os significados como constru{\'i}dos, sempre, em rela{\c c}{\~a}o a algum outro, ou seja, atrav{\'e}s de um processo dial{\'o}gico e constitu{\'i}do pelas rela{\c c}{\~o}es de poder existentes como defendido por Bakhtin (1929/1995), Foucault (1979) e Graddol (1994); e, (d) uma vis{\~a}o que define o curr{\'i}culo como um construto que transcende a organiza{\c c}{\~a}o e seria{\c c}{\~a}o de conte{\'u}dos, entendido como din{\^a}mico e aberto a mudan{\c c}as que possam ajust{\'a}-lo {\`a}s diferentes realidades dos aprendizes partindo das reflex{\~o}es de Apple (1990) e Cavallo (2000). Os dados foram coletados a partir de maio de 2002, de forma longitudinal, por dezoito meses, na medida em que os conte{\'u}dos do curso foram sendo trabalhados. O desenvolvimento do e-ducation possibilitou o estudo do fen{\^o}meno do processo reflexivo de coordenadores em um programa online de forma{\c c}{\~a}o continuada, investigado nos tr{\^e}s m{\'o}dulos que o compuseram: o primeiro abordou o t{\'o}pico estrat{\'e}gias de aprendizagem, o segundo explorou o conceito de senso comum pedag{\'o}gico e o terceiro compreendeu quest{\~o}es pertinentes {\`a} reflex{\~a}o de professores. Tomando como base os conceitos da abordagem Hermen{\^e}utico-Fenomenol{\'o}gica, a investiga{\c c}{\~a}o visou {\`a} descri{\c c}{\~a}o e interpreta{\c c}{\~a}o do fen{\^o}meno em foco, utilizando o processo de tematiza{\c c}{\~a}o sistematizado por Freire (2006), com base na proposta de van Manen (1990).

  abstract = {There is an increasing number of research which is interested in investigating the grammatical complexity of academic writing in English. Some examine first language (L1) English writers texts (e.g. GRAY, 2015; BIBER; GRAY, 2016; STAPLES et al., 2016) while others analyze texts written by second language (L2) English learners (e.g. PARKINSON;MUSGRAVE, 2014; NITSCH, 2017; ANSARIFAR et al., 2018). These studies investigate either or both pre- and post- noun modification arguing about how such devices may help in the elaboration or compression of information (GRAY, 2015). Noun premodification, inparticular, has shown to serve the function of adding new information to a noun head in a way that makes the phrase more economical and faster to read (BIBER; GRAY, 2010, 2016). This thesis, then, is a corpus-based descriptive study which explores the grammatical complexity of the English noun phrase (NP) in two subcorpora (general topic essays: 46 texts and 18678 words specific topic essays: 68 texts and 32509 words) of the Corpus of English for Academic Purposes (CorIFA), a corpus of Brazilian university students writings. The studyexamines the NPs found in students argumentative essays written in an upper intermediate English for Academic Purpose course and categorizes them according to their constituency into simple and complex NPs. To do so, we automatically parsed the texts and extracted theword groups parsed as NPs. We manually categorized them into simple and complex NPs, identifying their constituents and adding them to different subcategories, such as simple NP with a determiner and head noun or complex NP with prepositional phrases (PPs) aspostmodifiers. The investigation reveals that Brazilian writers use more complex NPs than simple ones and, particularly, NPs with premodifying adjectives and NPs with postmodifying PPs. All in all, our corpus-based research shows that upper intermediate Brazilian university students are capable of producing structurally complex and compressed NPs, but we argue for more research on the grammatical complexity of NPs with a larger learner corpus and across learners various disciplines as well as across registers.},

In this article, we present the data from the analysis of the campaign of the Brazilian Academy of Cordel Literature called ``Poetic Quarantine'' that started in April 2020 due to the implemented social isolation measures. Using methodological tools from Patrick Charaudeau's semiolinguistic theory, we investigate how scientific themes and representations of science emerge in the small works of cordel of the research corpus. In our results, we noticed the diversity of authors in this campaign and identified in their speech will the strategies and discursive organizations mobilized by them. We concluded that these representations appear alongside manifestations that describe the subjective experiences of the authors of the works of cordel, interspersed with conflicting views, which reflect and refract the controversial nature of science.}

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify the dimensions of variation of translated texts through the computational techniques of Multidimensional Analysis (MDA) and to reveal the extent to which there is variation in translations made by more experienced and less experienced translators. Two corpora were used in this study. They were organized from 2015 to 2018. The first corpus --- Reference Corpus in English (REFCEN) --- is a monolingual comparable corpus, tagged with the Biber Tagger and composed of texts originally written in English. It is organized to be used as a reference corpus of English language. It comprises 30 different registers with 20 texts each, totaling 600 texts and over 5 million words. The second corpus is called Corpus of Translated Texts (CTT), it is a bilingual aligned corpus, composed of three sub corpora. The first one is the Original texts in Brazilian Portuguese (OTP-BR), used only as the source of the translated texts, and the two other sub corpora comprise the same texts in the OTP-BR translated into English by more experienced translators (TE1) and by less experienced translators (TE2). Linguistic variation in translated texts has already been investigated, but there seem to be no studies that have included so many different registers or both spoken and written texts. This study aimed to fill this gap through the theoretical and methodological assumptions of Corpus Linguistics, more specifically of MDA, which enables a comprehensive investigation of both written and spoken translated registers based on a vast repertoire of linguistic characteristics. The hypothesis investigated here is that there is a lot of variation in translated texts motivated by translator experience. MDA is an effective and adequate methodology to reveal the dimensions of variation in translated text, as it captures translation-mediated patterns of variation by means of revealing patterns of co-occurrence, and providing descriptions of the relationship between translations made by more experienced and less experienced translators},

Considering the main newspaper of the city of S{\~a}o Paulo, in its digital platform, we have compiled a comprehensive corpus of news about homeless situation published in a period of three years. The choice to specifically address data from Folha de S Paulo is justified because it is the city with the largest homeless population in Brazil.

This study examines AI's ability to write essays analysing Old English poetry; human markers assessed and attempted to distinguish them from authentic analyses of poetry by first-year undergraduate students in English at the University of Oxford. Using the standard UK University grading system, AI-written essays averaged a score of 60.46, whilst human essays achieved 63.57, a margin of difference not statistically significant (               p               = 0.10). Notably, student submissions applied a nuanced understanding of cultural context and secondary criticism to their close reading, while AI essays often described rather than analysed, lacking depth in the evaluation of poetic features, and sometimes failing to properly recognise key aspects of passages. Distinguishing features of human essays included detailed and sustained analysis of poetic style, as well as spelling errors and lack of structural cohesion. AI essays, on the other hand, exhibited a more formal structure and tone but sometimes fell short in incisive critique of poetic form and effect. Human markers correctly identified the origin of essays 79.41\% of the time. Additionally, we compare three purported AI detectors, finding that the best, `Quillbot', correctly identified the origin of essays 95.59\% of the time. However, given the high threshold for academic misconduct, conclusively determining origin remains challenging. The research also highlights the potential benefits of generative AI's ability to advise on structuring essays and suggesting avenues for research. We advocate for transparency regarding AI's capabilities and limitations, and this study underscores the importance of human critical engagement in teaching and learning in Higher Education. As AI's proficiency grows, educators must reevaluate what authentic assessment is, and consider implementing dynamic, holistic methods to ensure academic integrity.},

"From Text to Action" provides an invaluable companion to Ricoeur's classic text, "The Conflict of Interpretations". Here he further develops his general theory of interpretation in relation to his own philosophical background and influences: Hegel, Husserl, Gadamer and Weber. This is a hugely important work from a key figure in contemporary philosophy that will be of interest to those starting out in the field of hermeneutics, as well as those already familiar with Ricoeur's work."The Continuum Impacts" are seminal works by the finest minds in contemporary thought, including Adorno, Badiou, Derrida, Heidegger and Deleuze. They are works of such power that they changed the philosophical and cultural landscape when they were first published and continue to resonate today.

  abstract = {Jane Austen began her career as an epistolary novelist at the end of the eighteenth century when the novel In letters was the most popular kind of fiction. By 1797 however, she had rejected the "pure"' letter narrative structure for narratives that included letters in them. The reasonsfor her change are suggested in the dissertation: the epistolary novel exemplified in Richardson's Clarissa is a form which depends on public referents, which assumes that the nature of man and his social order are essentially -uniform and stable, and which defines itself as a series of documents attesting to these fixed orders. Austen's concerns with the ambiguous relationship of the private life to public norms and with the changing nature of the family are not compatible to the epistolary structure.  In the decade of the 1790's, Austen wrote' four epistolary works: Love and Freindship, Lady Susan, Elinor and Marianne, and First Impressions. Of these, only the first has a subject compatible to its vehicle of the letter;: the later three because they were reworked into narratives with included letters suggest that Austen felt that letters were inadequate for her emerging theme of the collapse of social order. We see the narrating voice replace the ennervated public consensus of the eighteenth century. She abandoned the letter-structure with its implications of order and trust in public authority .for a narrative strategy that allowed her to explore a community -whose order had been shaken. The included letters in the novels function to show the loss of community, the decadence of the family, the shift from a Lockean to a Kantian world view, and the assertion of private values against public ones.  The included letters in each novel are examined and their functions defined. In Pride and Prejudice, the letter functions to discriminate between eighteenth and nineteenth century characters or between characters who remain essentially the same and those who change. In Northanger Abbey, the included letters frame and thereby expose the two "Gothics" of the novel. The letters of Mansfield Park mark the difference between the two languages of the novel - the language of the theatre and the language of real feeling. Only one letter is quoted completely in Emma: it tells its readers what they already know. Its function is to show us that we do not know as much as we need to know in order to be civilized. It defamiliarizes the familiar. In the revision of the finale of Persuasion, Austen embedded a letter which completes the shift from the function of the eighteenth century "public document" letter to the new function of the letter as a private "affective gesture." From Sense and Sensibility where the letter is rejected as evidence to! Persuasion where it is used as gesture, we see Austen's redefinition of the device of the letter in the structure of fiction.

The studies included in the volume are based on a wide range of corpora spanning first and second language academic writing at different levels of writing expertise, containing texts from a variety of academic disciplines (and sub-disciplines) and of different academic registers. Particularly novel aspects of the collection are the inclusion of research that combines rhetorical moves with multi-dimensional analysis, studies that cover both fixed and variable phraseological items (lexical bundles, phrase-frames, constructions), and work that is based on corpora of English as an academic lingua franca. Going beyond merely summarizing their findings, the authors also discuss what their research means for academic writing practice and pedagogical settings. The volume will be of interest to researchers, students, and teachers who would like to expand their knowledge of how academic writing functions and what it looks like in a variety of contexts.},

  abstract = {This article explores the origins of researcher development in British universities. Its principal aim is to provide a coherent, and reasonably succinct, account of the evolution and development of researcher development that is as consistent as possible with what is known about the  development of the Western university, the history of the research doctorate and the emergence of the research university. The main conclusion is that the origins of researcher development in the modern university can be found in the philology of the early modern university, which in turn  emerged from the accumulation of knowledge in Western Christendom from other places and other times. Other conclusions are that there was little researcher development in the medieval university, and that the 'traditional' model of researcher development, centred on the PhD, is much more recent  than is commonly supposed, so that, from a long-term perspective, the 'traditional model' may be but one stage in its continuing development. The article also develops a model that locates researcher development within a series of intellectual contexts: from the research process itself, to  the advancement of knowledge more generally, and, finally, to changes in conceptions of knowledge itself.},

The possibility of political biases embedded in these models raises concerns about their potential misusage. In this work, we report the results of administering 15 different political orientation tests (14 in English, 1 in Spanish) to a state-of-the-art Large Language Model, the popular ChatGPT from OpenAI. The results are consistent across tests; 14 of the 15 instruments diagnose ChatGPT answers to their questions as manifesting a preference for left-leaning viewpoints. When asked explicitly about its political preferences, ChatGPT often claims to hold no political opinions and to just strive to provide factual and neutral information. It is desirable that public facing artificial intelligence systems provide accurate and factual information about empirically verifiable issues, but such systems should strive for political neutrality on largely normative questions for which there is no straightforward way to empirically validate a viewpoint. Thus, ethical AI systems should present users with balanced arguments on the issue at hand and avoid claiming neutrality while displaying clear signs of political bias in their content.},

The most famous of Thurber's stories, it first appeared in The New Yorker on March 18, 1939, and was first collected in his book My World and Welcome to It (Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1942). It has since been reprinted in James Thurber: Writings and Drawings (The Library of America, 1996, ISBN 1-883011-22-1), is available on-line on the New Yorker website, and is one of the most anthologized short stories in American literature. The story is considered one of Thurber's "acknowledged masterpieces". It was made into a 1947 film of the same name, with Danny Kaye in the title role, though the film is very different from the original story. It was also adapted into a 2013 film, which is again very different from the original. The name Walter Mitty and the derivative word "Mittyesque" have entered the English language, denoting an ineffectual person who spends more time in heroic daydreams than paying attention to the real world, or more seriously, one who intentionally attempts to mislead or convince others that he is something that he is not. Warner Brothers studio head Jack L. Warner in his autobiography My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, described the actor Errol Flynn in the following way: "To the Walter Mittys of the world he was all the heroes in one magnificent, sexy, animal package."},

The benefits of their use are yet to be evaluated and concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy, transparency, and ethical implications of using this AI technology in academic publishing. At the moment, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is one of the most powerful and widely debated AI language models. Here, we discuss its feasibility to answer scientific questions, identify relevant literature, and assist writing in the field of human reproduction. With consideration of the scarcity of data on this topic, we assessed the feasibility of ChatGPT in academic writing, using data from six meta-analyses published in a leading journal of human reproduction. The text generated by ChatGPT was evaluated and compared to the original text by blinded reviewers. While ChatGPT can produce high-quality text and summarize information efficiently, its current ability to interpret data and answer scientific questions is limited, and it cannot be relied upon for a literature search or accurate source citation due to the potential spread of incomplete or false information. We advocate for open discussions within the reproductive medicine research community to explore the advantages and disadvantages of implementing this AI technology. Researchers and reviewers should be informed about AI language models, and we encourage authors to transparently disclose their use.},

Specifically, KCA is used to uncover the most dominant patterns of co-occurring keywords across a corpus of 37,676 texts from 235 pseudoscience and conspiracy websites that mention               vaccin*               . KCA enables researchers to examine linguistic patterns of fake news from multiple angles, including discourse, register, style, and attitude. Yet, the interpretation of KCA can be time-consuming, especially when texts are long. Consequently, in this study, we leverage ATLAS.ti's code co-occurrence analysis functionality, which streamlines and accelerates the interpretation of KCA results by providing access to extended concordances that highlight the patterns of keyword co-occurrence. Taking the second most prominent dimension as a demonstration, we interpret this pattern of keyword variation across our vaccination corpus as distinguishing texts that are questioning the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in relation to higher power control, from texts that are discussing childhood vaccines, especially with respect to the dangers they pose. The implications of these linguistic repertoires in relation to fake news and anti-science strategies are discussed.},

The creation becomes a significant act, at once paradigmatic and intensely human, when viewed as a repetition of Frankenstein's primal-scene trauma, with the Creature emerging as a representation of the scene and the related oedipal complex. A psychoanalytic interpretation, however, requires a drastic secondary revision of Frankenstein, and not enough insight is purchased by so much blindness. The analyst repeats, yet fails to elucidate, the misreading of world, self, and Creature that renders Frankenstein a tiresome neurotic. But before this personal collapse Frankenstein achieved the sublime. His catastrophe of origination, engendering a creative self that anxiously pursues an impossible desire and an artifact that both represents and eclipses the creator, serves as a paradigm of the genesis of any sublime artwork, any uncanny reanimation project.},

Currently these decentralised systems are being consolidated into wide scale signalling centres or dispatch offices. Whatever the form, signalling control provides an interface between the human signal operator and the lineside signalling equipment.

The railway signal-man of the title tells the narrator of an apparition that has been haunting him. Each spectral appearance precedes a tragic event on the railway on which the signalman works. The signalman's work is at a signal-box in a deep cutting near a tunnel entrance on a lonely stretch of the railway line, and he controls the movements of passing trains. When there is danger, his fellow signalmen alert him by telegraph and alarms. Three times, he receives phantom warnings of danger when his bell rings in a fashion that only he can hear. Each warning is followed by the appearance of the spectre, and then by a terrible accident. The first accident involves a terrible collision between two trains in the tunnel. Dickens may have based this incident on the Clayton Tunnel crash that occurred in 1861, five years before he wrote the story. Readers in 1866 would have been familiar with this major disaster. The second warning involves the mysterious death of a young woman on a passing train. The final warning is a premonition of the signalman's own death.},

No segundo semestre do ano letivo de 2017, esses alunos tiveram contato, por meio de um exerc{\'i}cio de compreens{\~a}o oral elaborado pela professora regente, com variedades que representam dois modelos distintos de ingl{\^e}s, a saber, o hegem{\^o}nico, representado por um falante norte-americano, e o n{\~a}o hegem{\^o}nico, representado por um falante indiano. Durante a atividade, grande parte dos alunos pesquisados apresentou predile{\c c}{\~a}o pelo sotaque norte-americano e, por sua vez, preteriram o indiano, corroborando, assim, a import{\^a}ncia da implementa{\c c}{\~a}o de atividades que promovam um olhar cr{\'i}tico acerca da l{\'i}ngua inglesa no contexto escolar. Diante disto, devemos salientar que o ensino de l{\'i}ngua inglesa apresentado neste estudo {\'e} norteado pelas premissas do ingl{\^e}s como l{\'i}ngua franca (ILF), cuja defini{\c c}{\~a}o ressignificada n{\~a}o se encaixa ao seu conceito antigo. (SIQUEIRA \& BARROS, 2013)            ,               ABSTRACT This article aims to discuss the importance of intercultural language teaching (BYRAM, 2008; SIQUEIRA, 2008, 2013; KRAMSCH, 2001) in school education based on analysis of the responses of sophomore students from Pandi{\'a} Cal{\'o}geras State School, which is located in the municipality of S{\~a}o Gon{\c c}alo - RJ. In the second semester of 2017, through a listening exercise designed by the teacher, these students had contact with varieties that represent two distinct types of English, that is, the hegemonic model, which was represented by a North American speaker, and the non-hegemonic one which was represented by an Indian speaker. During the activity, a large proportion of the students preferred the North American accent and disregarded the Indian one. Thus, this scenario corroborates the importance of intercultural activities that promote critical reflection on the English language within the school context. It is also important to point out that the English language teaching perspectives presented in this study are guided by the premises of English as a lingua franca (ILF), whose re-signified definition has moved beyond the original concept.

  abstract = {This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the ``transactional zone.'' The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts., ``When I use a word,'' Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, ``it means just what I choose it to mean---neither more nor less.''

Abstract: This paper discusses the meaning of tension based on Bakhtin and The Circle's concepts of comprehension and evaluation, considering that the construction of the meanings occurs in the encounter of two opposite poles, as an electric spark (VOLOCH{\'I}NOV, 2017 [1973]). The research questions are two: what is tension as a theoretical reflection? What are the possible tension points when considering comprehension and evaluation in the texts selected among the works of Bakhtin and The Circle? After the data collection phase in papers of a specialized journal, we noticed three works in which we verified a recurrence of the concepts analyzed. Theoretical definitions and reflections about the meaning of tension lead to two centers of circulation of clashing values. Concerning the outcome of this research, comprehension and evaluation (two centers of value) act as a double of each other in the preparation of an active response by a speaker.}

Drawing on recorded and transcribed data, it explores how higher-scoring learners manage spoken assessment tasks through their talk, moving conversations on or slowing them down in order to perform and complete the tasks' requirements in a timely way. These data are contrasted with the ways in which lower-scoring test candidates attempt to organize and manage assessed group talk. While the data and findings from this particular study can be used to teach students about, and prepare them for, multi-person discussions and, more specifically, task-oriented and time-limited group speaking tests, we also suggest that our awareness-raising investigatory approach, if brought into the classroom, offers learners (and teachers) a way of uncovering some of what actually occurs during talk, illuminating the `invisible rules' that guide how participants engage in and manage interaction.},

This article discusses three key aspects of source use -- academic attribution, searching and reading sources, and source integration. AI tools are trialled for each aspect, followed by an overall SWOT analysis. While writers can use AI tools to assist on several source use practices, they are not recommended to use AI without a deep understanding of academic writing and source use principles. This article concludes with suggestions for student writers, academic support providers, and institutions.}

  abstract = {A swell, also sometimes referred to as ground swell, in the context of an ocean, sea or lake, is a series of mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air under the predominating influence of gravity, and thus are often referred to as surface gravity waves. These surface gravity waves have their origin as wind waves, but are the consequence of dispersion of wind waves from distant weather systems, where wind blows for a duration of time over a fetch of water, and these waves move out from the source area at speeds that are a function of wave period and length. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not greatly affected by the local wind at that time. Swell waves often have a relatively long wavelength, as short wavelength waves carry less energy and dissipate faster, but this varies due to the size, strength, and duration of the weather system responsible for the swell and the size of the water body, and varies from event to event, and from the same event, over time. Occasionally, swells that are longer than 700m occur as a result of the most severe storms. Swell direction is the direction from which the swell is moving. It is given as a geographical direction, either in degrees, or in points of the compass, such as NNW or SW swell, and like winds, the direction given is generally the direction the swell is coming from. Swells have a narrower range of frequencies and directions than locally generated wind waves, because they have dispersed from their generation area and over time tend to sort by speed of propagation with the faster waves passing a distant point first. Swells take on a more defined shape and direction and are less random than locally generated wind waves.},

It is intended to identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving the objectives of the venture or project. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as a tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis, but has also been criticized for its limitations, and alternatives have been developed.},

Patients are often puzzled by this unconventional prescription, but when they "take" their cat for the recommended duration, they witness profound transformations in their lives, guided by the playful, empathetic, occasionally challenging yet endearing cats. Through the chapters of a disheartened businessman who finds unexpected joy in physical labor, a young girl navigating the complexities of elementary school cliques, a middle-aged man struggling to stay relevant at work and home, a hardened bag designer seeking emotional balance, and a geisha unable to move on from the memory of her lost cat, the power of the human-animal bond is revealed. As the clinic's patients navigate their inner turmoil and seek resolution, their feline companions lead them toward healing, self-discovery, and newfound hope"-- Provided by publisher},

Some media have speculated about the adverse effects of AI on human communication, discourse, and even cognition, although the scholarly evidence to either confirm or dismiss such claims is very limited. In order to bridge this knowledge gap, the following article was designed as a corpus-assisted study of discourse in ChatGPT-generated texts, making it one of the first inquiries into AI discourse to date. The study analyzes the growthist bias in ChatGPT (4o version) and a possible methodology of reliable detection and measurement of bias in AI using corpus tools. Two differently composed corpora of the responses of ChatGPT in the semantic domain of the economy are studied quantitatively through the generation and statistical comparison of word frequency lists, keywords, and other measures. This procedure serves to objectify the qualitative analysis data, as well as to outline the size and range of bias. The results of the critical analysis of AI discourse and biases is treated as the crucial ground for any global discussion of AI impact on human discourse, as well as for the speculation on the ideological stance of the source information used for the initial training of the chatbot.},

The authors argue that the multiplicity of communications channels and increasing cultural and linguistic diversity in the world today call for a much broader view of literacy than portrayed by traditional language-based approaches. Multiliteracies, according to the authors, overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches by emphasizing how negotiating the multiple linguistic and cultural differences in our society is central to the pragmatics of the working, civic, and private lives of students. The authors maintain that the use of multiliteracies approaches to pedagogy will enable students to achieve the authors' twin goals for literacy learning: creating access to the evolving language of work, power, and community, and fostering the critical engagement necessary for them to design their social futures and achieve success through fulfilling employment.},

LLMs have been rapidly adopted due to their capabilities in a range of tasks, including essay composition, code writing, explanation, and debugging, with OpenAI's ChatGPT popularizing their usage among millions ofusers. The crux of the study centers around LangChain, designed to expedite the development of bespoke AI applications using LLMs. LangChain has been widely recognized in the AI community for its ability to seamlessly interact with various data sources and applications. The paper provides an examination of LangChain's core features, including its components and chains, acting as modular abstractions and customizable, use-case-specific pipelines, respectively. Through a series of practical examples, the study elucidates the potential of this framework in fostering the swift development of LLM-based applications.}

Most practitioners and researchers agree that, in order to succeed in American schools, such learners must be given the opportunity to acquire academic, rather than everyday, language.Unfortunately, in spite of the growing interest in the kind of language that will result in school success, we currently lack a single definition or even general agreement about what is meant by academic language. Although this has been discouraging and problematic for a number of practitioners, what is significant is that many more groups and individuals are now engaging in the examination of what they understand to be academic language and inquiring about its role in the school success of language-minority children. It is my position that it is both useful and productive to try to unravel and examine what different individuals mean by the various terms used to refer to academic language and particularly to understand the dialogic nature of the discussion itself -- a discussion held at professional meetings, at conferences, in articles published in journals, and in entire books written by scholars as they consciously or unconsciously respond to other voices in the dialogue. These voices include those heard through the popular media, those of political activists of various types and backgrounds, and those of everyday citizens who want to inform themselves before voting on now-popular propositions that directly focus on language.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Religious faith is a long-standing feature of humankind, which influences interpersonal relations in terms of moral values and attitudes. The major world religions have each a set of holy books on which their faith is based, which comprise their major teachings, stories and values shared by the followers. Therefore, understanding religious discourse is essential for perceiving how faith may impact on society. Following Biber's (1988) and Berber Sardinha's (2019) multi-dimensional analysis models, I have carried out a comprehensive study of the holy books of the world's major religions to identify the most representative themes in them through a lexical multi-dimensional analysis. This type of analysis allows for the identification of the underlying parameters of variation across the texts, which in turn signal the discourses that shape the religions. Importantly, the dimensions enable a comparison across the various faiths, providing a means to verify the extent to which the various religions are similar or different with respect to the themes evoked by their texts. The corpus for this study consists of the dogmatic texts in English from seven religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islamism, Judaism, Kardecist Spiritism, Mormonism, and Protestantism. The major books for each religion were collected and saved into electronic format, each representing chapters or sub-chapters and then they were fully tagged and lemmatized with the Tree-Tagger; the lemmas were counted, and their normed counts were entered in a factorial analysis in SPSS. Six factors were extracted, including 285 lemmas. These lemmas were concordanced in WordSmith 7 to help the interpretive process. Each factor received an interpretive label to indicate the major underlying discourses, such as, for example, morality and worship. The texts were scored on each dimension, and the scores were compared across the religions on each dimension. In addition to the lexical multi-dimensional analysis, I carried out a cluster analysis to identify the main text types according to the lexical correlations and a discriminant analysis to verify if texts displayed characteristics of their own religious groups. In this study, the six identified lexical dimensions and the text types will be introduced, and the similarities and differences across the religious texts will be discussed},

  abstract = {Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as "is aspartame linked to cancer". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider "which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.},

The means to conduct this study was found in an opportunity to teach the C1 Advanced Preparation Tutorial at Faculdade Cultura Inglesa in a remote learning setting over two terms in 2020 and two terms in 2021. Reflective tools were employed to observe and analyse the phenomena in the virtual classroom via reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action (SCH{\"O}N, 1983) on an iterative basis to ensure a continuous process of improvement of my pedagogical practice (CELANI, 2008; KOLB, 2015; FREEMAN, 1998). Reflective practice procedures (SCH{\"O}N, 1983; VAN MANEN, 2016) allowed for the identification of needs for adjustment in the first sessions of the tutorial that led to changes required to increase the relevance of the learning experience of the students. After reviewing the main results, this article will conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of the reflective practice procedures (SCH{\"O}N, 1983; VAN MANEN, 2016) in adapting classes to remote learning settings while establishing a safe learning environment, raising the teachers' awareness of the students' learning objectives and motivations while still maintaining a high-quality learning experience.},

John's version was recorded at Trident Studios in London in January 1970 and appeared in April as the first cut on his self-titled second studio album. Following "Border Song" as the first album single, "Your Song" was released in the United States in October 1970 as the B-side to "Take Me to the Pilot". Both sides received airplay, but "Your Song" was preferred by disc jockeys and replaced "Take Me to the Pilot" as the A-side, eventually making it to number eight on the Billboard chart. The song also peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as charting in the top 10 in several other countries. In 1998, "Your Song" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, the song was placed at number 136 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", 137 in its 2010 list, and 202 in its 2021 list. The song is listed among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. A demo version was included in John's 1990 box set album To Be Continued. In 2017, the song was voted by the British public as The Nation's Favourite Elton John Song in a UK-wide poll for ITV. The song has been covered by a number of artists, including Rod Stewart, Lady Gaga and Ellie Goulding. The song was also covered by Ewan McGregor and opera singer Alessandro Safina in the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! and by Taron Egerton in the 2019 film Rocketman. In 2018, the song was certified 2{\texttimes} Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).},

  abstract = {Abstract             ChatGPT and similar generative AI models are increasingly being integrated into educational practice, including second language (L2) writing. However, AI-generated writing may significantly differ from that of developing L2 writers, raising potential issues over academic integrity. With AI detectors still underused in many contexts due to accuracy concerns, it is essential to determine if and how AI-generated texts are similar or different to those of L2 writers. This study compares lexical and collocation choices between essays on the same topic generated by ChatGPT (version 3.5) and human L2 writers using corpus analytic techniques. R statistical software was used for analysis and comparison. Results suggest that when tasked with producing academic essays under the same topic, ChatGPT-3.5 excels in generating texts with formal and complex vocabulary suited for academic and technical themes, while human L2 writers tend to focus on personal and social issues, using more varied and context-rich vocabulary. Accordingly, educators seeking to detect AI use should recognise the distinct linguistic and cultural experiences L2 writers bring to their writing, while students using AI need to understand the nature of the machine-like clarity and directness of expression as produced by ChatGPT as compared with their own typical production.},

  abstract = {This study set out to identify and characterize extended collocational networks, or ``collocational dimensions'', as they are represented in written academic English, through a bottom-up approach, following Berber Sardinha (2017). It has been established in the literature that collocational networks exist for individual node words hence collocational networks could exist for collocates across nodes, which would be evidenced in a dimension of collocation. Thus, this study set out to extend the concept of collocational networks by identifying the major sets of collocational patterns across nodes, or ``collocational dimensions'', in academic writing. The Corpus of Academic Texts (CAT) was designed and compiled for this study. It comprises textbooks and journal articles, divided into five subcorpora, one per discipline, according to research discipline areas of the National Science Foundation (NSF): Biological Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering; Engineering; Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. To accomplish this goal, multivariate statistical procedures, such as exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis were employed. The exploratory factor analysis led to the identification of 11 collocational dimensions, i.e., dimensions of extended collocational patterns, comprising a total of 10,474 unique collocations, namely: (1) Finance and Economics; (2) Classification; (3) Social and Cultural Development; (4) Exerting Influence and Shaping Outcomes; (5) Empirical Research Methods; (6) Local and Global Society; (7) Reporting Research; (8) Individuals in Society; (9) Gaining Knowledge and Developing Concepts; (10) Social Welfare; (11) Marking Time and Sectioning. The cluster analysis revealed five clusters, which reflected semantic groupings of nodes},
